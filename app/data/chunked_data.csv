0,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']","About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students That was after having spent about 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous"
1,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," So I did a pretest when they came And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: ""Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?"" And I put them together so that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child mortality of the other And this means that it's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data"
2,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And these were the results of the Swedish students I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow And I got happy, of course — a 18 right answer out of five possible That means there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course (Laughter) But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery"
3,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," (Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey They would be right half of the cases But the students are not there The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there"
4,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," So we did this software, which displays it like this Every bubble here is a country This country over here is China This is India The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, ""What do you really think about the world?"" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly"
5,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']","' And 'we' is the Western world and 'them' is the Third World"" ""And what do you mean with 'Western world?'"" I said ""Well, that's long life and small family And 'Third World' is short life and large family"" So this is what I could display here I put fertility rate here — number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries"
6,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives And these were the developing countries They had large families and they had relatively short lives Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change"
7,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," We stopped the world then This is all UN statistics that have been available Here we go Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families The Africans are the green here They still remain here"
8,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries But now, Bangladesh — it's a miracle that happens in the '80s — the imams start to promote family planning, and they move up into that corner And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries"
9,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam 1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives And this is what happens The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families"
10,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war I think we all, if we don't look at the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economic change"
11,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," This is the world distribution of income of people One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day There's no gap between rich and poor any longer This is a myth There's a little hump here But there are people all the way And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent of the world's annual income And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent"
12,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income We heard it in other forms And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa This is Africa Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty This is OECD — the rich countries, the country club of the UN And they are over here on this side"
13,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And this is Latin America It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia And what did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then, there was more of a hump And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia"
14,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world We'll have most people in the middle Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase"
15,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there In some countries, 99"
16,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa The linearity is very strong between child survival and money But let me split sub-Saharan Africa Health is there and better health is up there I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population"
17,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America There's a huge difference [within] Africa And Ghana is here in the middle In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid Here in Uganda, development aid Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday"
18,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," I can split South Asia here India's the big bubble in the middle But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka I can split Arab states How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion — huge difference Even between neighbors — Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used Not as the myth is And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country"
19,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Many people say data is bad There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently And there is Latin America Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America"
20,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move This is Mao Zedong He brought health to China And then he died And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again"
21,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960 I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one The label went away for me here And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there I can run it forward, like this And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower"
22,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates They came from here, a mineral country They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket You have to invest in health You have to get kids into schooling You have to train health staff You have to educate the population And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here"
23,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries — they are like this That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960 If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda These are the quintiles of Uganda The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there"
24,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," If I split South Africa, it's like this And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine [recently], it's like this The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss what solutions there should be in Africa Everything in this world exists in Africa"
25,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level We must be much more detailed We find that students get very excited when they can use this And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing"
26,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Because the data is hidden down in the databases And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics (Laughter) And this won't work"
27,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," It's not a new database that you need We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design, we called ""Gapminder,"" from the London Underground, where they warn you, ""Mind the gap"" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate And we started to write software which could link the data like this And it wasn't that difficult It took some person years, and we have produced animations"
28,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world But what we really need is, of course, a search function, a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units Everyone says, ""It's impossible This can't be done"
29,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world"" But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly funded data is down here And we would like flowers to grow out on the net One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there And I have pretty good news for you"
30,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," He only says, ""We can't do it"" (Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh? (Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways This is the income distribution of China, 1970 This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970 Almost no overlap Almost no overlap"
31,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," (Laughter) But I think it's very important to have all this information We need really to see it And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000 In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have"
32,The best stats you've ever seen,Hans Rosling,"['global issues', 'health']"," Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods But this is hypothesis-generating I end now with the world There, the internet is coming The number of internet users are going up like this This is the GDP per capita And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries"
33,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture'],"Good morning How are you? (Audience) Good It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing In fact, I'm leaving (Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it"
34,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," No idea how this may play out I have an interest in education Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education Don't you? I find this very interesting If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education — actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly (Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously That's strange to me"
35,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," They're like, ""Oh my God Why me?"" (Laughter) ""My one night out all week"" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do"
36,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary"
37,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity"
38,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," (Applause) Thank you (Applause) That was it, by the way Thank you very much (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left (Laughter) ""Well, I was born  "" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently — I love telling it — of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did The teacher was fascinated"
39,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture'],""" And the teacher said, ""But nobody knows what God looks like"" And the girl said, ""They will in a minute"" (Laughter) When my son was four in England — actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year He was in the Nativity play Do you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it"
40,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture'],""" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about We considered this to be one of the lead parts We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: ""James Robinson IS Joseph!"" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh This really happened"
41,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, ""I bring you gold"" And the second boy said, ""I bring you myrrh"" And the third boy said, ""Frank sent this"" (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance If they don't know, they'll have a go Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong"
42,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original — if you're not prepared to be wrong And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity They have become frightened of being wrong And we run our companies like this We stigmatize mistakes And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make"
43,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it Or rather, we get educated out of it So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was"
44,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Are you struck by a new thought? I was You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it I mean, he was seven at some point He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) ""Must try harder"
45,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," ""And put the pencil down!"" (Laughter) ""And stop speaking like that"" (Laughter) ""It's confusing everybody"" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition Actually, my son didn't want to come I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16 He didn't want to come to Los Angeles He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England This was the love of his life, Sarah"
46,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16 He was really upset on the plane He said, ""I'll never find another girl like Sarah"" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly — (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country"
47,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Every one Doesn't matter where you go You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities At the bottom are the arts Everywhere on earth And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance"
48,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Why? Why not? I think this is rather important I think math is very important, but so is dance Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up And then we focus on their heads And slightly to one side"
49,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top And I used to be one, so there (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement They're just a form of life Another form of life But they're rather curious And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors"
50,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," They live up there and slightly to one side They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings (Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night"
51,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it (Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability And there's a reason Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas"
52,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that Is that right? ""Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist"" Benign advice — now, profoundly mistaken The whole world is engulfed in a revolution"
53,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized And I think we can't afford to go on that way"
54,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," More people And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one And I didn't want one, frankly"
55,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," It's a process of academic inflation And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence We know three things about intelligence One, it's diverse We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically We think in abstract terms, we think in movement Secondly, intelligence is dynamic"
56,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," The brain isn't divided into compartments In fact, creativity — which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value — more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum It's thicker in women"
57,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often  thankfully (Laughter) No, she's good at some things But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling — (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here"
58,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I say, ""Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here"" (Laughter) ""Give me a break"" (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, ""If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?"" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, ""If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct"
59,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I'm fascinated by how people got to be there It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne Have you heard of her? Some have She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work She did ""Cats"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"" She's wonderful I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day"
60,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," When she was at school, she was really hopeless And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, ""We think Gillian has a learning disorder"" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting I think now they'd say she had ADHD Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point It wasn't an available condition (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that"
61,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on Little kid of eight"
62,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I need to speak to her privately Wait here We'll be back We won't be very long,"" and they went and left her But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, ""Just stand and watch her"" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, ""Mrs"
63,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," She's a dancer Take her to a dance school"" I said, ""What happened?"" She said, ""She did I can't tell you how wonderful it was We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me — people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think"" Who had to move to think They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School"
64,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down"
65,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity And for the future, it won't serve us We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children"
66,Do schools kill creativity?,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish"" And he's right What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are"
67,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']","I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner 17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped"
68,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," (Laughter) ""What 'tis to love?"" Shakespeare said I think our ancestors — I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love"
69,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']",""" As a truck driver once said to me, ""The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne"" George Bernard Shaw said it differently ""Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another"" And indeed, that's what we do (Laughter) And then you just focus on this person You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do As Chaucer said, ""Love is blind"
70,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot — their car is different from every other car in the parking lot Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat And it goes like this It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen ""I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat"
71,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']",""" He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them You aggrandize them But you have intense energy As one Polynesian said, ""I felt like jumping in the sky"" You're up all night You're walking till dawn"
72,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," Real dependence on this person As one businessman in New York said to me, ""Anything she liked, I liked"" Simple Romantic love is very simple You become extremely sexually possessive You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this"
73,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc, to tell you that they love you The other main characteristic is motivation The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person And last but not least, it is an obsession"
74,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," But my most important question was always the same It was: ""What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"" And indeed, they would say, ""All day All night I can never stop thinking about him or her"" And then, the very last question — I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation My final question was always the same"
75,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," I was just staggered by it So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state And we found activity in a lot of brain regions In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine"
76,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low But actually, it's a drive It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work The motor of the brain It's a drive"
77,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, ""No, thank you,"" you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it People live for love They kill for love They die for love They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system"
78,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification WH Auden called it an ""intolerable neural itch,"" and indeed, that's what it is It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love"
79,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car It can be focused on nobody I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy"
80,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner The first is women working, moving into the workforce I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations"
81,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," It's very slow For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend We all know of them, but nevertheless — the Arabs say, ""The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on"" And, indeed, that caravan is moving on Women are moving back into the job market And I say back into the job market, because this is not new For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables"
82,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," The double income family was the standard And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men In short, we're really moving forward to the past Then, women's worst invention was the plow With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful"
83,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal And it's going to have an impact I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love"
84,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common We are — in the words of Ted Hughes, ""I think that we are like two feet We need each other to get ahead"" But we did not evolve to have the same brain And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love"
85,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," Women can talk Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man Women can talk They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force"
86,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And I think that the television is like the global campfire We sit around it and it shapes our minds Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, ""To have a great writer is to have another government"" Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women"
87,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills They're highly imaginative We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning They tend to be web thinkers Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers"
88,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," They're both perfectly good ways of thinking We need both of them to get ahead In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world And there's also many more male idiots in the world (Laughter) When the male brain works well, it works extremely well And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed"
89,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, ""Why is it that men are so adulterous?"" ""Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"" ""Well, men are more adulterous!"" And I say, ""Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"" (Laughter) And — basic math! Anyway"
90,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality"
91,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']",""" This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit We're also seeing a rise of romantic love 91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person"
92,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85"
93,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline It may decline some more"
94,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now However, there's always kinds of complications in this These three brain systems — lust, romantic love and attachment — don't always go together They can go together, by the way"
95,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin — those are associated with attachment This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them"
96,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else"
97,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce I think the happiness we find, we make And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other So I want to conclude with two things I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story The worry is about antidepressants"
98,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And these drugs are going generic They are seeping around the world I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants — since she was 13 She's 23 She's been on them ever since she was 13 I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something horrible They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else I would recommend it"
99,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit Everybody knows that Dopamine is associated with romantic love Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment The things are connected in the brain"
100,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place So now — (Applause) Thank you I want to end with a story And then, just a comment I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike"
101,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']","com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them I said, ""I don't know anything about personality You know? I don't know Do you think you've got the right person?"" They said, ""Yes"" It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another That's my current project; it will be my next book There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another"
102,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," Proximity is important Mystery is important You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your ""love map,"" an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up"
103,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And that's what I'm now contributing to this But I want to tell you a story, to illustrate I've been carrying on here about the biology of love I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one — probably a true story It was a graduate student — I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues — Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook"
104,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him And they were all at a conference in Beijing And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love (Laughter) So he decided he'd put science to work"
105,"Why we love, why we cheat",Helen Fisher,"['culture', 'science']"," And sure enough — I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting He figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time"
106,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']","I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called ""Blink,"" and it's about snap judgments and first impressions And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate (Laughter) But I was thinking about this, and I realized that although my new book makes me happy, and I think would make my mother happy, it's not really about happiness"
107,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Howard's about this high, and he's round, and he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair, and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality, and he has a parrot, and he loves the opera, and he's a great aficionado of medieval history And by profession, he's a psychophysicist"
108,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Which should tell you something about that relationship (Laughter) As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things And Howard is very interested in measuring things And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York And one of his first clients was Pepsi This is many years ago, back in the early 70s"
109,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink"" Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer, and that's what Howard thought Because Pepsi told him, ""We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet"
110,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi, at every degree of sweetness — eight percent, 81, 82, 83, all the way up to 12 — and we try this out with thousands of people, and we plot the results on a curve, and we take the most popular concentration, right? Really simple Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve"
111,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," It's a mess It's all over the place Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such, are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess They think, ""Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy"" ""You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way"" ""You know, let's just make an educated guess,"" and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle"
112,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years And he would think it through and say, ""What was wrong? Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"" And one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains, about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him"
113,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis Trust me This was an enormous revelation This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science Howard immediately went on the road, and he would go to conferences around the country, and he would stand up and say, ""You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi You're wrong You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis"
114,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']",""" And they would say, ""Move! Next!"" Tried to get business, nobody would hire him — he was obsessed, though, and he talked about it and talked about it Howard loves the Yiddish expression ""To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish"" This was his horseradish (Laughter) He was obsessed with it! And finally, he had a breakthrough Vlasic Pickles came to him, and they said, ""Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle"
115,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']",""" And he came back to them and he said, ""You don't just need to improve your regular; you need to create zesty"" And that's where we got zesty pickles Then the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup And this was even more important In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation Campbell's made Prego, and Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Ragù, which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s"
116,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," But it was, technically speaking — this is an aside — Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù The quality of the tomato paste is much better; the spice mix is far superior; it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way In fact, they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right? And the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top"
117,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']",""" And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence, and the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us And Howard looked at their product line, and he said, what you have is a dead tomato society So he said, this is what I want to do And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce"
118,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," (Laughter) Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road He went to New York, to Chicago, he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls And he sat them down for two hours, and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls"
119,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100, how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months, he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce And then he analyzed the data Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce? No! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing"
120,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people who like it extra chunky"
121,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," And Prego turned to Howard, and they said, ""You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs?"" And he said ""Yes!"" (Laughter) And Prego then went back, and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce, and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country"
122,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said, ""Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!"" And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil And then eventually even Ragù hired Howard, and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego"
123,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," (Laughter) That's Howard's doing That is Howard's gift to the American people Now why is that important? (Laughter) It is, in fact, enormously important I'll explain to you why What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat, what will make people happy, is to ask them"
124,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']",""" And for all those years — 20, 30 years — through all those focus group sessions, no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did (Laughter) People don't know what they want! As Howard loves to say, ""The mind knows not what the tongue wants"
125,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say? Every one of you would say, ""I want a dark, rich, hearty roast"" It's what people always say when you ask them ""What do you like?"" ""Dark, rich, hearty roast!"" What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast? According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you Most of you like milky, weak coffee"
126,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']",""" So that's number one thing that Howard did Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize — it's another very critical point — he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call ""horizontal segmentation"" Why is this critical? Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard What were they obsessed with in the early 80s? They were obsessed with mustard"
127,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Used to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's What were they? Yellow mustard What's in it? Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika That was mustard Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon Right? Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit, much more delicate aromatics"
128,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," (Laughter) And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle, the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars And they had those ads With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon"
129,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now, and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy (Laughter) A better mustard! A more expensive mustard! A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning And Howard looked to that and said, ""That's wrong!"" Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane There is no good mustard or bad mustard"
130,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish"
131,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," You go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction They don't give you five options on the reduction They don't say, ""Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ?"" No! You just get the reduction Why? Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi ""This is the way it ought to be"
132,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']",""" Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was And where did that come from? It came from Italy Italian tomato sauce is what? It's blended; it's thin The culture of tomato sauce was thin"
133,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," That's what it was And why were we attached to that? Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce, then they would embrace it And that's what would please the maximum number of people In other words, people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals"
134,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave"
135,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer I guess my cancer different from your cancer Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, ""This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce"" And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks"
136,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice And the example he used was coffee And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafé"
137,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Malcolm Gladwell,"['business', 'culture']"," If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78 The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy"

139,The surprising science of happiness,Dan Gilbert,"['culture', 'science']"," And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part, called the ""frontal lobe,"" particularly, a part called the ""prefrontal cortex"" What does a prefrontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time? Well, it turns out the prefrontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is it's an experience simulator"

194,The paradox of choice,Barry Schwartz,"['business', 'culture']"," And what happens is, this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose Second, what economists call ""opportunity costs"
195,The paradox of choice,Barry Schwartz,"['business', 'culture']"," Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it's easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen Here's an example [I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th Street] If you're not a New Yorker, I apologize Here's what you're supposed to be thinking Here's this couple on the Hamptons Very expensive real estate"

198,The paradox of choice,Barry Schwartz,"['business', 'culture']"," Third: escalation of expectations This hit me when I went to replace my jeans I wear jeans almost all the time There was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap They were incredibly uncomfortable, and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones I said, ""I want a pair of jeans Here's my size"

206,The paradox of choice,Barry Schwartz,"['business', 'culture']"," Now, as a policy matter — I'm almost done — as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice Their problem is they have too little So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies"
207,The paradox of choice,Barry Schwartz,"['business', 'culture']"," It's a waste of money What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices — it's not simply that they don't help They actually hurt They actually make us worse off If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also"

David Gallo says, ""Push yourself Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push"" You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt Goldie Hawn says, ""I always had self-doubts I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough I didn't think I'd make it"" Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers"
214,8 secrets of success,Richard St. John,"['business', 'culture', 'entertainment']",""" (Laughter) Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, ""It was a privilege to serve as a doctor"" A lot of kids want to be millionaires The first thing I say is: ""OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value Because that's the way people really get rich"" Ideas! TEDster Bill Gates says, ""I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company"" I'd say it was a pretty good idea"
215,8 secrets of success,Richard St. John,"['business', 'culture', 'entertainment']"," And I give lots of evidence Persist! Joe Kraus says, ""Persistence is the number one reason for our success"" You've got to persist through failure You've got to persist through crap! Which of course means ""Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure"" (Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED"
216,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']","So, I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find Coca-Cola tins on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey (Laughter) And so I just came, two days ago, from the Himalayas to your kind invitation So I would like to invite you, also, for a while, to the Himalayas themselves And to show the place where meditators, like me, who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute, and found their way to the mountains"
217,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," There's Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet — wonderful setting This is from Marlboro country (Laughter) This is a turquoise lake A meditator This is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1 And the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said, ""We are going to sleep outside"" And I said, ""Why? We have enough space in the tent"" They said, ""Yes, but it's summertime"
218,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," As a Frenchman, I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting (Laughter) I just wrote an essay on happiness, and there was a controversy And someone wrote an article saying, ""Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness"" (Laughter) ""We don't care about being happy We need to live with passion We like the ups and downs of life"
219,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']",""" (Laughter) This is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas It's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time (Laughter) Now, let's come to happiness or well-being"
220,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," As Pascal said, even the one who hangs himself, somehow, is looking for cessation of suffering He finds no other way But then, if you look in the literature, East and West, you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness Some people say, I only believed in remembering the past, imagining the future, never the present Some people say happiness is right now; it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment"
221,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']",""" Well, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often, although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it Although we want to avoid suffering, it seems we are running somewhat towards it"
222,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure But if you look at the characteristics of those two, pleasure is contingent upon time, upon its object, upon the place It is something that — changes of nature Beautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious, second one not so much, then we feel disgust (Laughter) That's the nature of things We get tired I used to be a fan of Bach I used to play it on the guitar, you know"
223,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," If I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring If you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful After some moments, you just go a little back, and then it starts burning It sort of uses itself as you experience it And also, again, it can — also, it's something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside Like, you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot"
224,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," And so, I think the best definition, according to the Buddhist view, is that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment A state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states, and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way For you, that might be surprising Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad? In a way, why not? Because we are speaking of a different level"
225,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," When you are at the bottom of the wave, you hit the bottom You hit the solid rock When you are surfing on the top, you are all elated So you go from elation to depression — there's no depth Now, if you look at the high sea, there might be beautiful, calm ocean, like a mirror There might be storms, but the depth of the ocean is still there, unchanged So now, how is that? It can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation"
226,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," But there's also wicked joy, you can rejoice in someone's suffering So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness? Very often, we look outside We think that if we could gather this and that, all the conditions, something that we say, ""Everything to be happy — to have everything to be happy"" That very sentence already reveals the doom, destruction of happiness To have everything If we miss something, it collapses"
227,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," So now, look at inner conditions Aren't they stronger? Isn't it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering? And isn't that stronger? We know, by experience, that we can be what we call ""a little paradise,"" and yet, be completely unhappy within The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal, and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere"
228,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']",""" So now, at the opposite, we know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances, manage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence So now, if the inner conditions are stronger — of course, the outer conditions do influence, and it's wonderful to live longer, healthier, to have access to information, education, to be able to travel, to have freedom It's highly desirable However, this is not enough"
229,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," The experience that translates everything is within the mind So then, when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness, the inner conditions, and which are those which will undermine happiness So then, this just needs to have some experience We have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being, what the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing"
230,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," And so, if we look from our own experience, anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance, obsessive desire, strong grasping, they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it And also, they are detrimental to others' happiness So we may consider that the more those are invading our mind, and, like a chain reaction, the more we feel miserable, we feel tormented"
231,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']", We don't need the recognition We don't need any gratitude Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature And we would like to be like that all the time
232,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it You can have ugly faces, beautiful faces in the mirror The mirror allows that, but the mirror is not tainted, is not modified, is not altered by those images Likewise, behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness, pure awareness This is the nature"
233,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," We know we're not always angry, always jealous, always generous So, because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone, there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting That is the ground for mind training Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time You could go from love to hate"
234,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," You cannot, in the same gesture, shake hand and give a blow So, there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being So that's the way to proceed Rejoicing compared to jealousy A kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession Benevolence, loving kindness against hatred But, of course, each emotion then would need a particular antidote"
235,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Usually, when we feel annoyed, hatred or upset with someone, or obsessed with something, the mind goes again and again to that object Each time it goes to the object, it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance So then, it's a self-perpetuating process So what we need to look for now is, instead of looking outward, we look inward Look at anger itself It looks very menacing, like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm"
236,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Likewise, if you look at the thought of anger, it will vanish like frost under the morning sun If you do this again and again, the propensity, the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it And, at the end, although it may rise, it will just cross the mind, like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track So this is the principal of mind training"
237,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," But that's the only way to go Mind transformation — that is the very meaning of meditation It means familiarization with a new way of being, new way of perceiving things, which is more in adequation with reality, with interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation, which our being and our consciousness is"
238,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," The brain was thought to be more or less fixed All the nominal connections, in numbers and quantities, were thought, until the last 20 years, to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age Now, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot"
239,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," So can we do that with human qualities? With loving kindness, with patience, with openness? So that's what those great meditators have been doing Some of them who came to the labs, like in Madison, Wisconsin, or in Berkeley, did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation They do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day And then, the rest of their life, they will do three or four hours a day"
240,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," (Laughter) This is the place where the meditators — you can see it's kind of inspiring Now, here with 256 electrodes (Laughter) So what did they find? Of course, same thing The scientific embargo — a paper has been submitted to ""Nature,"" hopefully, it will be accepted It deals with the state of compassion, unconditional compassion"
241,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Of course, during the training, we do that with objects We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading Here is the preliminary result, which I can show because it's already been shown The bell curve shows 150 controls, and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe"
242,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," They don't describe a lot of positive affect It's the opposite on the left side: more tendency to altruism, to happiness, to express, and curiosity and so forth So there's a basic line for people And also, it can be changed If you see a comic movie, you go off to the left side If you are happy about something, you'll go more to the left side If you have a bout of depression, you'll go to the right side Here, the -0"
243,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," It's something that is totally out of the bell curve So, I've no time to go into all the different scientific results Hopefully, they will come But they found that — this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI, it's like coming out of a space ship Also, it has been shown in other labs — for instance, Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley — that some meditators are able, also, to control their emotional response more than it could be thought"
244,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," If you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus measuring your physiology, and there's kind of a bomb that goes off, it's such an instinctive response that, in 20 years, they never saw anyone who would not jump Some meditators, without trying to stop it, but simply by being completely open, thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star, they are able not to move at all"
245,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," It's more to say that mind training matters That this is not just a luxury This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul This is something that's going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education We love to do jogging, fitness We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful"
246,The habits of happiness,Matthieu Ricard,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Now, compassion is supposed to be put in action That's what we try to do in different places Just this one example is worth a lot of work This lady with bone TB, left alone in a tent, was going to die with her only daughter One year later, how she is Different schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet And just, I leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than I could ever say"
247,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment'],"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a ""mathemagician"" What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call ""mathemagics"" But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand Raise your hand"
248,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back You sir, that's three And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle Would the four of you please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage Let's give them a nice round of applause (Applause) That's right Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators, I need to make sure that they are all working properly"
249,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," AB: 22 And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47 AB: Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No AB: 594 Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there (Applause) Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case? OK, great What I'm going to try and do then — I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer"
250,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25 AB: 25"
251,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an ""x squared"" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method"
252,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please Audience: 37 Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK Audience: 23 AB: 23 squared, OK Audience: 59 AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93 AB: 93 squared Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369 AB: 1369 Volunteer: 529 AB: 529 Volunteer: 3481 AB: 3481 Volunteer: 8649 AB: Thank you very much (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further"
253,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," I won't even write these down — I'll just call them out as they're called out to me Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number Anyone on our panel, verify the answer Just give some indication if it's right A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987 AB: 987 squared is 974,169 (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good Another three-digit — (Applause) — another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457 AB: 457 squared is 205,849"
254,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," AB: 321 is 103,041 103,041 Yes? One more three-digit number please Audience: Oh, 722 AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more three-digit number please Audience: 162 162 squared is 26,244 Volunteer: Yes Thank you very much (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further (Laughter) I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time"
255,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square Nine Seven Five Eight 9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me 95 million — (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much"
256,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity — don't you hate that? So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators — what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it AB: I'll talk to you later In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649"
257,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain Seven Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say ""No"" (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt the impossible — or at least the improbable"
258,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine the digit you've left out Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2 AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5 I think I only heard five numbers I — wait — 44875 — did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK"
259,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4 I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000: 10 to the fourth power OK, any six of them (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2 Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause Thank you very much"
260,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on? If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand Let's see, starting with — let's start with a gentleman first What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first Audience: 1953 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd — was that a Monday? Audience: Yes Good Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up"
261,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," 1959, OK — and the month? Audience: February February what? Sixth — was that a Friday? Audience: Yes Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947 AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May AB: May what? Seventh — would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes AB: Thank you very much (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way"
262,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," I brought with me a book of calendars It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir — you were just sitting there (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind This is a book of calendars Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966 66 — turn to the calendar with 1966 And what month? Audience: April"
263,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," I believe that was a Sunday Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s — that'll be a much greater challenge for me AB: What year would you like? CA: 1824 AB: 1824, OK AB: And what month? CA: June AB: June what? CA: Sixth AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was"
264,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Good, thank you very much (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are"
265,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so — I think we're OK"
266,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four Oh, I did this row already Let's do the row before you, starting with you: one, two, three, four, five Call out a single digit — that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead Five Seven Six Eight Three 57,683 — squared Yuck Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem I'm going to break the problem down into three parts"
267,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer Now, let me recap (Laughter) Thank you (Laughter) While I explain something else — (Laughter) — I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation Let me explain what that is"
268,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers I know it sounds complicated; it's not I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of ""Rain Man"" (Laughter) There's definitely a method to my madness — definitely, definitely Sorry (Laughter) If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then"
269,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, ""you're close,"" or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer — which could be pretty entertaining in itself If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK So, without any more stalling, here we go"
270,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Arthur Benjamin,['entertainment']," 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 38,931; double that to get 77,862 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822 That seems right, I'll go on Cookie fission, OK Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion"
271,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']","We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea, and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down, it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe: these blinking lights — a world of bioluminescence, like fireflies Dr"
272,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," That's all bioluminescence Like I said: just like fireflies There's a flying turkey under a tree (Laughter) I'm a geologist by training But I love that And you see, some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten, some they use to attract prey, but all of it, from an artistic point of view, is just positively amazing And a lot of what goes on inside — There's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes"
273,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," And then this last one, one of my favorites, this pinwheel design Just absolutely amazing, every single dive That's the unknown world, and today we've only explored about 3 percent of what's out there in the ocean Already we've found the world's highest mountains, the world's deepest valleys, underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls — a lot of that we shared with you from the stage"
274,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," There's still 97 percent, and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing Cephalopods — head-foots As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly (Laughter) This is an octopus This is the work of Dr"
275,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," Here's an octopus moving across the reef, finds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background Tough thing to do In the next bit, we're going to see a couple squid Now males, when they fight, if they're really aggressive, they turn white And these two males are fighting They do it by bouncing their butts together, which is an interesting concept"
276,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," (Laughter) Let's take a look at it again Watch the coloration: white on the right, brown on the left He takes a step back, he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body, and comes up on the other side — Bingo! Now, I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males, but I don't know (Laughter) Cuttlefish I love cuttlefish This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish And there he is, his droopy little eyes up here"
277,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice, and watch his tentacles — he just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae Disappears right into the background Positively amazing Here's two males fighting Once again, they're smart enough, these cephalopods; they know not to hurt each other But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin That's an amazing thing Here's an octopus"
278,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," This guy can make himself look like a rock, and, looking at his environment, can actually slide across the bottom, using the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen His motion blends right into the background — the moving rock trick So, we're learning lots new from the shallow water Still exploring the deep, but learning lots from the shallow water"
279,Underwater astonishments,David Gallo,"['science', 'technology']"," In the next scene, you're going to see a nice coral bottom And you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage, use your skin to change color and texture Here's some algae in the foreground — and an octopus Ain't that amazing?

307,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science'],"There is nothing bigger or older than the universe The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from? How did the universe come into being? Are we alone in the universe? Is there alien life out there? What is the future of the human race? Up until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding"
308,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," This meant they must have been closer together in the past If we extrapolate back, we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago This was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe But was there anything before the Big Bang? If not, what created the universe? Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did? We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts"
309,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct"
310,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," This removes the distinction between time and space, and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing Moreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background, which is an imprint of the very early universe"
311,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence I now turn to the second big question: are we alone, or is there other life in the universe? We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets, of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy But we don't know how life first appeared"
312,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," The first is that we have fossils of algae from 35 billion years ago The Earth was formed 46 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high"
313,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens I am discounting the reports of UFOs Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos? If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring, it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project, we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows"
314,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet This brings me to the last of the big questions: the future of the human race If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history"
315,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand or million Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years"
316,Questioning the universe,Stephen Hawking,['science']," That is why I am in favor of manned — or should I say, personned — space flight All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe, and we are making good progress"

Now earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV, I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight So, let's take a look (Video) Man: There we go I'm going to guide you into the car Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter) Man: You're OK, keep on going KT: How are you? Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here"
353,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KT: OK, but don't say my name like that KB: But you're OK? KT: Yes KB: No way to see through it? KT: No KB: I'll take it off Do you want to take the rest off? Take it off, you're OK We'll stop for a second KT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see KB: You're fine, take it off You're OK You're safe Have you ever heard of second sight? KT: No KB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes"
354,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KT: God KB: Are you ready? Where is it? There's no way — KT: (Beep) KT: Oh, my God! KB: Don't say anything, I'm trying to see through your eyes I can't see KT: There's a wall, there's a wall KB: Look at the road, look at the road KT: OK, OK, OK Oh, my God! KB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No KB: Sure there's not? KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road I'm looking at the road, all the time I'm not taking my eyes off the road"
355,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: What? KT: How are you doing this? KB: Just don't break my concentration We're OK, though? KT: Yes That's so weird We're nearly there Oh, my God! Oh, my God! KB: And I've stopped KT: That is weird You're like a freak-ass of nature That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life! (Applause) KB: Thank you"
356,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," So, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes? That's the question Now, most people here would automatically say no OK, but I want you to realize some facts I couldn't see through the blindfold The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way The girl, I'd never met before, all right So, I want you to just think about it for a moment"
357,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark This is because magic is all about directing attention If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it But if I wanted you to look at my right hand, then I look at it, too You see, it's very simple, once you know how, but very complicated in other ways"
358,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," I need two people to help me out real quick Can you come up? And let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick? Do you mind? Yes, at the end OK, give them a round of applause as they come up You might want to use the stairs, there (Applause) It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you"
359,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: Nicole, and? (Telephone ringing) KB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it (Laughter) Is it a girl? Man: They've already gone KB: OK, swap over positions Can you stand over here? This will make it easier Pity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades OK, a little bit closer (Laughter) OK, a little bit closer, come over — they look really nervous up here Do you believe in witchcraft? Nicole: No"
360,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK I want you to just stand exactly like this for me, pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind OK, now, I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you, because we'll try a voodoo experiment I want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you, and don't open your eyes until I ask you"
361,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," Yes or no, did you feel anything? Nicole: Yes KB: You did feel that? What did you feel? Nicole: A touch on my back KB: How many times did you feel it? Nicole: Twice KB: Twice OK, extend your left arm out in front of you Extend your left arm, OK OK, keep it there Be aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK Did you feel anything, there? Nicole: Yes"
362,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: Can you show us where? OK, excellent Open your eyes I never touched you I just touched his back, and I just touched his arm A voodoo experiment (Laughter) Yeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this (Laughter) You just take a seat over here for a second I'm going to use you again, in a moment Can you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind Sit right here Man: OK KB: OK, take a seat Excellent, OK"
363,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one Close your eyes right now OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here"
364,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," That's it, all the way down, all the way down and further, and further Excellent I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop OK, now, allow it to stay there OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK, and I want you to be aware of the pressure Just be aware of the pressure"
365,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," Do you understand? Just answer yes or no Man: Yes KB: Hold it right there And only when you feel the pressure go back, allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop, but only when you feel the pressure (Laughter) OK, that was wonderfully done Let's try it again Excellent Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed"
366,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," I want you to point directly at his forehead OK Imagine a connection between you and him Only when you want the pressure to be released, make an upward gesture, like this, but only when you want it to be released You can wait as long as you want, but only when you want the pressure released OK, let's try it again OK, now, imagine the connection, OK Point directly at his forehead Only when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again"
367,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," And hold it there, both of you Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture You can wait as long as you want You did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK Now, I want you to be aware that in a moment, when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened"
368,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," On five, four, three, two, one — open your eyes, wide awake Give them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats (Applause) OK, you can go back (Applause) I once saw a film called ""The Gods Are Crazy"" Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane, and it landed on the ground, and it didn't break? Now, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle"
369,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," She's not taking any chances (Laughter) You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes For some magicians or mentalists, sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not It depends on how much energy you have that day, so on and so forth We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now"
370,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," Excellent Now, have a look at the Coke bottle Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful Even though it's solid, I'm standing away I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb Excellent Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK I want you to examine the shard of glass Careful, it's sharp Just hold on to it for a moment"
371,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship, from that guy, being imparted into the broken piece of glass, which will represent him, OK But I want you to take this very seriously Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here"
372,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," Think of that guy, that ba — that guy (Laughter) I'm trying to be good here OK, and when you feel the sensation — it might take a while — drop it into the glass OK, drop it in Now, imagine all that negative energy in there Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side (Burst) (Laughter) That was a lot of negative energy, built up in there"
373,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," OK, think of how many letters in the title of his name There's five letters in the title You didn't react to that, so it's four letters Think of one of the letters in the title There's a K in his name, there is a K I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him Was that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm KB: OK, give her a round of applause"
374,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," (Applause) (Applause ends) I've got one more thing to share with you right now Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment? And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing Chris Anderson: Oh, OK KB: I was going to use you, but I decided I might want to come back another year"
375,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: OK, Steve, come on up here (Applause) CA: You knew! KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here Excellent Now, Steve — oh, you can check underneath Go ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there They insist that because I was a magician, put a nice, black tablecloth on There you are, OK (Laughter) I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve One, two, three and four"
376,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," I want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid Happy? Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes KB: OK"
377,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," I'll also look away So, go ahead and mix them up, now OK, and tell me when you're done (Laughter) (Laughter) KB: You done? SJ: Almost KB: Almost, oh OK, you're making sure that's well hidden Oh, we've got one here, we've got one here (Applause) So, all right, we'll leave them like that (Laughter) I'm going to have the last laugh, though"
378,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny No, stay around, OK Now, Steve, look back Now you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold? SJ: Put this on? KB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No? SJ: No, I can't see through it KB: Excellent Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold Don't stack them up, OK Give them an extra mix up"
379,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," I'll put the blindfold on Give them an extra mix up No messing around this time OK, go ahead, mix them up My hand is at risk here (Laughter) Tell me when you're done SJ: Done KB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand Your right hand Tell me when I'm over a cup SJ: You're over a cup KB: I'm over a cup, right now? SJ: Mm-hmm KB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no? SJ: Oh! (Laughter) KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh"
380,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: No? Good decision (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I go this way, is there another cup over here? SJ: Can we do the left hand? KB: Oh, no, no, no He asked me could he do the left hand Absolutely not (Laughter) KB: If I go this way, is there another cup? SJ: Yes KB: Tell me when to stop SJ: OK KB: There? SJ: Yes, there's one KB: OK Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine"
381,Brain magic,Keith Barry,['entertainment']," KB: Good decision (Laughter) OK, give me both hands Now, put them on both cups Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand? SJ: Neither KB: Neither, oh, OK But if you were to guess (Laughter) SJ: Under my right hand KB: Under your right hand? Now, remember, you made all the decisions all along Psychologists, figure this out (SJ gasps) Have a look SJ: Oh! (Applause) KB: Thank you"
382,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']","I am a writer Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course It is also my great lifelong love and fascination And I don't expect that that's ever going to change But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work"
383,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed Seriously — doomed, doomed! Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say, ""Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that? Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?"" So that's reassuring, you know"
384,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And people would say, ""Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success? Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you? Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"" (Laughter) Like that, you know"
385,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']",""" Yes, I'm afraid of all those things And I always have been And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at, like seaweed and other things that are scary"
386,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']",
387,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," (Laughter) We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable"
388,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said, ""Every one of my books has killed me a little more"" An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work"
389,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea? Are you comfortable with that? Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know — I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live"
390,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," Which is — you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me"
391,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," So Jesus, what a thought! That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there (Laughter) I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love"
392,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And, as I've been looking, over the last year, for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome So stay with me, because it does circle around and back"
393,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity ""daemons"" Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual"
394,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," So brilliant — there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about — that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work"
395,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know? Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame (Laughter) And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time"
396,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius, rather than having a genius And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error"
397,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years"
398,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," Maybe not Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically, fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this"
399,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something — which is to say basically everyone here —- knows does not always behave rationally And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal"
400,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And she said it was like a thunderous train of air And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, ""run like hell"
401,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it ""for another poet"
402,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first (Laughter) So when I heard that I was like — that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like"
403,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times And I would imagine that a lot of you have too You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify"
404,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles, and this is when it all changed for him"
405,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, ""I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be haunted by this song forever I'm not good enough, and I can't do it"" And instead of panicking, he just stopped He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel"
406,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," Otherwise, go bother somebody else today Go bother Leonard Cohen"" And his whole work process changed after that Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing"
407,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once It saved me when I was in the middle of writing ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written Not just bad, but the worst book ever written"
408,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room And I said aloud, ""Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right? Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this"
409,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job"" (Laughter) Because — (Applause) Because in the end it's like this, OK — centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn"
410,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human"
411,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, ""Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God"" That's God, you know"
412,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic, ""Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo,"" incomprehensible, there it is — a glimpse of God Which is great, because we need that But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 am, and he's no longer a glimpse of God"
413,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life? This is hard This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you"
414,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid"
415,Your elusive creative genius,Elizabeth Gilbert,"['culture', 'entertainment']"," Just do your job Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be If your job is to dance, do your dance If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment through your efforts, then ""Olé!"" And if not, do your dance anyhow And ""Olé!"" to you, nonetheless I believe this and I feel that we must teach it"
416,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment'],"The ""Dirty Jobs"" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig It's only a couple dozen square miles It's in the Rockies And the job in question was sheep rancher My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it — it's pretty simple I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who do the jobs in question"
417,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," The job in question: herding sheep Great We go to Craig and we check into a hotel, and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work Normally, I never do any research at all But this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do And we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals"
418,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Can you tell me the deal?"" And they're like, ""Yeah, it's pretty straightforward"" They use a band, basically, a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday — (Laughter) But it had a certain familiarity to it And I said, ""Well, what exactly is the process?"" And they said, ""The band is applied to the tail, tightly And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly"
419,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," ""Great — got it"" OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this They confirm it I also call PETA just for fun, and they don't like it, but they confirm it OK, that's basically how you do it So the next day I go out And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry Melanie is the wife of Albert Albert is the shepherd in question"
420,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up Alright Great Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around I always watch the process done the first time before I try it Being an apprentice, you know, you do that Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band, but what comes out instead is a knife"
421,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," it was impressive In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly, the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding A second later, with a big thumb and a well-calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip"
422,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," But what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall, and I am not even kidding Can we roll the video? No, I'm kidding, we don't — (Laughter) I thought it best to talk in pictures I do something now I've never, ever done on a ""Dirty Jobs"" shoot, ever I say, ""Time out Stop"" You guys know the show, we use take one; we don't do take two There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense"
423,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," This is nuts"" I mean — (Laughter) ""This is crazy We can't do this"" And Albert's like, ""What?"" And I'm like, ""I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket, and that's not how we do it"" He said ""Well, that's how we do it"" I said, ""Why would you do it this way?"" And before I even let him explain, I said, ""I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands"
424,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed We're on in five continents, dude! We're on twice a day on the Discovery — we can't do this"" He says, ""OK"" He goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum"
425,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all Gets up, walks to the corner It's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, ""Albert, how long? When does he get up?"" He's like, ""A day?"" I said, ""A day! How long does it take them to fall off?"" ""A week"" Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped"
426,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," And I was just so blown away at how completely wrong I was, in that second And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time (Laughter) And I was especially reminded of what a ridiculously short straw I had that day, because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen"
427,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Albert hands me the knife I go in, tail comes off I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off Albert instructs, ""Push it way up there"" I do ""Push it further"" I do The testicles emerge They look like thumbs, coming right at you And he says, ""Bite 'em Just bite 'em off"
428,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity (Laughter) And I'm like, ""What is this jacked-up metaphor? I don't like what I'm thinking right now"" And I can't get this thought out of my head, and I can't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do I went in and I took them I took them like this, and I yanked my head back"
429,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," (Laughter) And now I can't get — I can't shake the metaphor I'm still in ""Poetics,"" in Aristotle, and I'm thinking — out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head, that I hadn't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there And they are ""anagnorisis"" and ""peripeteia"" Anagnorisis and peripeteia Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis"
430,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day Great The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies — Euripides and Sophocles That's the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother That's peripety, or peripeteia"
431,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," When you start to look for peripeteia, you find it everywhere I mean, Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense,"" right? Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then — boom! — ""Oh, I'm dead"" Peripeteia You know? It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way Neo in ""The Matrix,"" you know? ""Oh, I'm living in a computer program That's weird"" These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations"
432,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," And, as I stood there, looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK; looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by — if I'm wrong about that, and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon? Because, look — I'm not a social anthropologist, but I have a friend who is And I talk to him"
433,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state? You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing, you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry"
434,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day ""And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively, it might be time to think about it Because, dude, you know, four years"" So, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around And, after that shoot, ""Dirty Jobs"" really didn't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally"
435,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong; some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not People with dirty jobs are happier than you think As a group, they're the happiest people I know And I don't want to start whistling ""Look for the Union Label,"" and all that happy-worker crap I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work"
436,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment'], They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life And I see it over and over and over again So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows? Follow your passion — we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that? It's probably the worst advice I ever got
437,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out I can give you 30 examples right now Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine Why? Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat, his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he's one rich pig farmer"
438,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," He's making a great living You ask him, ""Did you follow your passion here?"" and he'd laugh at you The guy's worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas He didn't follow his passion He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going, and he went the other way And I hear that story over and over"
439,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Now he's selling them to Walmart, right? Follow his passion? The guy's — come on So I started to look at passion, I started to look at efficiency vs effectiveness As Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction I started to look at teamwork and determination"
440,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Safety Safety first is  Going back to OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: What if OSHA got it wrong? I mean — this is heresy, what I'm about to say — but what if it's really safety third? Right? (Laughter) No, I mean, really What I mean to say is: I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done — they're not out there talking about safety first"
441,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat with the ""Deadliest Catch"" guys — which I also work on in the first season We were about 100 miles off the coast of Russia: 50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right? Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen, and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down"
442,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Unspeakably dangerous I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity, ""Captain — OSHA?"" And he says, ""OSHA? Ocean"" And he points out there (Laughter) But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the Lower 48 It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site"
443,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," My responsibility is not to get you home alive My responsibility is to get you home rich"" (Laughter) You want to get home alive, that's on you"" And for the rest of that day — safety first I mean, I was like — So, the idea that we create this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own, and vice versa Anyhow, a whole lot of things"
444,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," But what it all comes down to is this: I've formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds It goes like this: we've declared war on work, as a society — all of us It's a civil war It's a cold war, really We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood"
445,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack, admit it You see him all the time That's what plumbers look like, right? We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines That's what TV does We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue"
446,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment'],""" It's all in there, over and over, again and again Washington? I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom-line reality of the available jobs, because I don't really know; I just know that that's a front in this war And right here, guys — Silicon Valley I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now? How many people have their BlackBerry? We're plugged in; we're connected"
447,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," Good grief, not to this crowd (Laughter) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time And nobody celebrates imitation the way ""Dirty Jobs"" guys know it has to be done Your iPhone without those people making the same interface, the same circuitry, the same board, over and over — all of that — that's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it So, we've got this new toolbox"
448,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," They look like the stuff we walk around with And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs And I realized, probably too late in this game — I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we're going to do as many as we can"
449,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," I got a lot wrong So, we're thinking — by ""we,"" I mean me — (Laughter) that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work — manual labor, skilled labor Somebody needs to be out there, talking about the forgotten benefits I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of — you know, kind of lost a little Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs The infrastructure is a huge deal"
450,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," The infrastructure is the first one, declining trade school enrollments are the second one Every single year, fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters, fewer steam fitters The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline, over and over"
451,Learning from dirty jobs,Mike Rowe,['entertainment']," So, if I were running for anything — and I'm not — I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites"
452,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']","I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense — a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across And some of you may argue, ""Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"" But I would say no"
453,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior"
454,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf — and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time I'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device"
455,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him The system tracks the four significant fingers In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize But if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors"
456,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the ""take a picture"" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc, again using all natural gestures"
457,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is available, and interact with this projected data The device is completely portable, and can be — (Applause) (Applause ends) So, one important difference is that it's totally mobile"
458,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in ""Minority Report,"" the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels"
459,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," He can ask for additional information So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice (Laughter) If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating — it gets projected right on the cover of the book"
460,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book — reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page Reading the newspaper — it never has to be outdated"
461,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," You can get the latest sports scores, etc This is a more controversial one (Laughter) As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc"
462,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Pattie Maes,"['design', 'technology']"," So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this (Applause and cheering) (Applause ends) He does deserve a lot of applause, because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually"

465,10 things you didn't know about orgasm,Mary Roach,"['culture', 'science']"," People with spinal cord injuries, like paraplegias, quadriplegias, will often develop a very, very sensitive area right above the level of their injury, wherever that is There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature I think the most curious one that I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth"
466,10 things you didn't know about orgasm,Mary Roach,"['culture', 'science']"," And she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste, but no — it happened with any brand They stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it No It was the whole, you know, motion And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene"
467,10 things you didn't know about orgasm,Mary Roach,"['culture', 'science']",""" It's so sad (Laughter) When I was working on the book, I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm She was part of a study at Rutgers University You've got to love that Rutgers So I interviewed her in Oakland, in a sushi restaurant And I said, ""So, could you do it right here?"" And she said, ""Yeah, but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind"" (Laughter) But afterwards, she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside"
468,10 things you didn't know about orgasm,Mary Roach,"['culture', 'science']"," It took about one minute And I said to her, ""Are you just doing this all the time?"" (Laughter) She said, ""No Honestly, when I get home, I'm usually too tired"" (Laughter) She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram (Laughter) The headquarters for orgasm, along the spinal nerve, is something called the sacral nerve root, which is back here"
469,10 things you didn't know about orgasm,Mary Roach,"['culture', 'science']"," And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people — a certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver Now this is somebody who is brain-dead, legally dead, definitely checked out, but is being kept alive on a respirator, so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation Now in one of these brain-dead people, if you trigger the right spot, you will see something every now and then"

483,10 things you didn't know about orgasm,Mary Roach,"['culture', 'science']"," Because, as I mentioned, the clitoris is inside the vagina So possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks And I also said to her, ""Now, these sows I mean, you may have noticed there The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy"" And she said, you can't make that conclusion, because animals don't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do Pigs, for example, are more like dogs"

488,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture'],"For me they normally happen, these career crises, often, actually, on a Sunday evening, just as the sun is starting to set, and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow"
489,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety I want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers Why we might be victims of these career crises, as we're weeping softly into our pillows One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs"
490,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," There's a real problem with snobbery, because sometimes people from outside the UK imagine that snobbery is a distinctively UK phenomenon, fixated on country houses and titles The bad news is that's not true Snobbery is a global phenomenon; we are a global organization, this is a global phenomenon What is a snob? A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you, and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are That is snobbery"
491,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," You encounter it within minutes at a party, when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century, ""What do you do?"" According to how you answer that question, people are either incredibly delighted to see you, or look at their watch and make their excuses (Laughter) Now, the opposite of a snob is your mother"
492,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Unfortunately, most people are not our mothers Most people make a strict correlation between how much time, and if you like, love — not romantic love, though that may be something — but love in general, respect — they are willing to accord us, that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods"
493,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," I don't think we are particularly materialistic I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods It's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want It's a new way of looking at luxury goods The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think, ""This is somebody who's greedy"" Think, ""This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love"
494,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," There are other reasons — (Laughter) There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before One of these, and it's paradoxical, because it's linked to something that's rather nice, is the hope we all have for our careers Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan We're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything"
495,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," And it's a beautiful idea Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality; we're all basically equal There are no strictly defined hierarchies There is one really big problem with this, and that problem is envy Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy, but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy And it's linked to the spirit of equality Let me explain"
496,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Even though she is much richer than any of you are, and she's got a very large house, the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird (Laughter) She's simply too strange We can't relate to her, she speaks in a funny way, she comes from an odd place So we can't relate to her, and when you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them"
497,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," The problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school Everybody's wearing jeans, everybody's the same And yet, they're not So there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality, which can make for a very stressful situation It's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates, as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy"
498,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," It's made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets, that if you've got energy, a few bright ideas about technology, a garage — you, too, could start a major thing (Laughter) The consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections, as I sometimes do — if you analyze self-help books produced in the world today, there are basically two kinds"
499,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture'],""" There's a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything, and the existence of low self-esteem So that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious — about our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before And it's, again, linked to something nice And that nice thing is called meritocracy"
500,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," In other words — what is a meritocratic society? A meritocratic society is one in which, if you've got talent and energy and skill, you will get to the top, nothing should hold you back It's a beautiful idea"
501,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," In other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental, but merited and deserved And that makes failure seem much more crushing You know, in the Middle Ages, in England, when you met a very poor person, that person would be described as an ""unfortunate"" — literally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate"
502,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture'],""" There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser, and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives It's no longer the gods, it's us We're in the driving seat That's exhilarating if you're doing well, and very crushing if you're not It leads, in the worst cases — in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim — it leads to increased rates of suicide"
503,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally — they own their success, but they also own their failure Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've been outlining? I think there is I just want to turn to a few of them Let's take meritocracy This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to, I think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy"
504,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic; it's an impossible dream The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded, the good at the top, bad at the bottom, exactly done as it should be, is impossible There are simply too many random factors: accidents, accidents of birth, accidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc"
505,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St Augustine in ""The City of God,"" where he says, ""It's a sin to judge any man by his post"" In modern English that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to, dependent on their business card It's not the post that should count According to St"
506,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Insane idea, if you're a secularist person, like me But something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless In other words, hold your horses when you're coming to judge people You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is That is an unknown part of them, and we shouldn't behave as though it is known There is another source of solace and comfort for all this"
507,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others And it exists The number one organ of ridicule, nowadays, is the newspaper If you open the newspaper any day of the week, it's full of people who've messed up their lives They've slept with the wrong person, taken the wrong substance, passed the wrong piece of legislation — whatever it is, and then are fit for ridicule In other words, they have failed And they are described as ""losers"
508,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Tragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece, in the fifth century BC, was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail, and also according them a level of sympathy, which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them A few years ago, I was thinking about this, and I went to ""The Sunday Sport,"" a tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading if you're not familiar with it already"
509,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories, if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon I mentioned Othello; they'd not heard of it but were fascinated (Laughter) I asked them to write a headline for the story They came up with ""Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter"" Splashed across the headline I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary"
510,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," And they wrote ""Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud"" (Laughter) And then my favorite — they really do have a kind of genius of their own, these guys — my favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King: ""Sex With Mum Was Blinding"" (Laughter) (Applause) In a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy, you've got the tabloid newspaper At the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art"
511,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser He is not a loser, though he has lost And I think that is the message of tragedy to us, and why it's so very, very important, I think The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety, is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves"
512,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," And so we tend to worship ourselves Our heroes are human heroes That's a very new situation Most other societies have had, right at their center, the worship of something transcendent: a god, a spirit, a natural force, the universe, whatever it is — something else that is being worshiped We've slightly lost the habit of doing that, which is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature"
513,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," It's an escape from our own competition, and our own dramas And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans, and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters, etc We like to feel in contact with something that is non-human, and that is so deeply important to us What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means"
514,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," You'd think that person might have made a lot of money, achieved renown in some field My own theory of success — I'm somebody who's very interested in success, I really want to be successful, always thinking, how can I be more successful? But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced about what that word ""success"" might mean Here's an insight that I've had about success: You can't be successful at everything"
515,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Nonsense You can't have it all You can't So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is And I think any wise life will accept, as I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own"
516,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years No one's quite listening hard enough, but I very much believe it's true And we also suck in messages from everything from the television, to advertising, to marketing, etc These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession, a lot of us want to go into banking"
517,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," We are highly open to suggestion So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own We should focus in on our ideas, and make sure that we own them; that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions"
518,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," So, I'm going to end it there But what I really want to stress is: by all means, success, yes But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas Let's probe away at our notions of success Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own Thank you very much (Applause) Chris Anderson: That was fascinating"
519,"A kinder, gentler philosophy of success",Alain de Botton,['culture']," Now I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible So we should do everything we can to pursue it, but we should always remember that whoever is facing us, whatever has happened in their lives, there will be a strong element of the haphazard That's what I'm trying to leave room for; otherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic"

""Kermit the Frog means nothing to me"
565,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces, and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed, with very large teeth or very large eyes And these frightened her Well, what is going on with these people? As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on and to reassure people, especially to reassure them that they're not going insane"
566,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them, because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something And if they do mention them to their own doctors, they may be misdiagnosed In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things, you're going mad But the psychotic hallucinations are quite different Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal, they address you"
567,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," You interact with them There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations There is a film You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you — or that's how people think about it There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy, and sometimes, if one has this, one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past You're at a particular road junction You smell chestnuts roasting"
568,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," All the senses are involved And you're waiting for your girl And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982 The temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations, full of feeling, full of familiarity, located in space and time, coherent, dramatic The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different"
569,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations And one of the second commonest is cartoons So, what is going on? Fascinatingly, in the last few years, it's been possible to do functional brain imagery, to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating, and, in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating"
570,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns You don't form images with your primary visual cortex When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved, in the temporal lobe And in particular, one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus, they may lose the ability to recognize faces"
571,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them It's very interesting that that should be specific"
572,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain, but particular cells ""Face cells"" were discovered around 1970 And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells, which can be very, very specific So you may not only have ""car"" cells, you may have ""Aston Martin"" cells (Laughter) I saw an Aston Martin this morning I had to bring it in (Laughter) And now it's in there, somewhere"
573,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex, where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images, or figments or fragmentary figments, all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells"
574,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex So, suddenly, you see a face Suddenly, you see a car Suddenly this and suddenly that The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this, but not terribly successfully"
575,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," But, in fact, people say, ""I don't recognize the people I can't form any associations Kermit means nothing to me"" You don't get anywhere, thinking of them as dreams Well, I've more or less said what I wanted I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common Think of the number of blind people There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations but are too scared to mention them"
576,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," Finally, I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable, for giving one some insight as to how the brain works Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago — he wondered how, thinking of these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain Now, 250 years later, I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done Thanks very much (Applause) Chris Anderson: That was superb Thank you so much"
577,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about? Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you would ask that (Laughter) Well, yeah, a lot of them And, actually, I'm a little visually impaired myself I'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other And I see the geometrical hallucinations But they stop there"
578,What hallucination reveals about our minds,Oliver Sacks,[]," They occasionally interest me, and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks I've gone and had an fMRI myself, to see how my visual cortex is ticking over And when I see all these hexagons and complex things, which I also have, in visual migraine, I wonder whether everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit CA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk"
579,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture'],"I'm a storyteller And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call ""the danger of the single story"" I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books"
580,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria I had never been outside Nigeria We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because there was no need to My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer, because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was"
581,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," But that is another story What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify Now, things changed when I discovered African books"
582,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature I started to write about things I recognized Now, I loved those American and British books I read They stirred my imagination They opened up new worlds for me"
583,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family My father was a professor My mother was an administrator And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages So, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy His name was Fide"
584,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say, ""Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing"" So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made I was startled"
585,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor Their poverty was my single story of them Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States I was 19 My American roommate was shocked by me"
586,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," She asked if she could listen to what she called my ""tribal music,"" and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey (Laughter) She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe"
587,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," I must say that before I went to the US, I didn't consciously identify as African But in the US, whenever Africa came up, people turned to me Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African"
588,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture'],""" (Laughter) So, after I had spent some years in the US as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me"
589,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage"
590,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture'],""" Now, I've laughed every time I've read this And one must admire the imagination of John Lok But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are ""half devil, half child"
591,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture'],""" Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was The professor told me that my characters were too much like him, an educated and middle-class man My characters drove cars They were not starving"
592,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the US The political climate in the US at the time was tense, and there were debates going on about immigration And, as often happens in America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans"
593,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing I remember first feeling slight surprise And then, I was overwhelmed with shame I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant"
594,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is ""nkali"" It's a noun that loosely translates to ""to be greater than another"
595,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, ""secondly"" Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story"
596,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel I told him that I had just read a novel called ""American Psycho"" — (Laughter) — and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers (Laughter) (Applause) Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation"
597,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," This is not because I am a better person than that student, but because of America's cultural and economic power, I had many stories of America I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill I did not have a single story of America When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me"
598,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries"
599,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives All of these stories make me who I am But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete They make one story become the only story"
600,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult"
601,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," So what if before my Mexican trip, I had followed the immigration debate from both sides, the US and the Mexican? What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking? What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls ""a balance of stories"
602,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," He disagreed He felt that people who could read, would read, if you made literature affordable and available to them Shortly after he published my first novel, I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview, and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said, ""I really liked your novel I didn't like the ending Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen "
603,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," I was not only charmed, I was very moved Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel"
604,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture'],
605,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me how many people apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories"
606,The danger of a single story,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,['culture']," Stories matter Many stories matter Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind"
607,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']","We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us There are an enormous number of them that we use every day Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life"
608,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," A gesture of ""Namaste!"", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe, in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means ""four runs"" in cricket It comes as a part of our everyday learning So, I am very interested, from the beginning, how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world"
609,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it Most of you might be aware that, in those days, the mouse used to come with a ball inside, and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving, and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend — never returned to him — and I now had four rollers"
610,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," It had some strings and pulleys and some springs What I got is basically a gesture-interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000 Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds, I thought of sticky notes"
611,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, ""What is Dr Smith's address?"" and this small system actually prints it out — so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper In another exploration, I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions"
612,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Then I thought, ""Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?"" Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly"
613,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing What we are interested in is information We want to know about things We want to know about dynamic things going around"
614,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels? So, in order to realize this dream, I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head"
615,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," So now, what I can do — I can augment the world around me with this digital information But later, I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device"
616,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," You can start using any surface, any wall around you, as an interface The camera is actually tracking all your gestures Whatever you're doing with your hands, it's understanding that gesture And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it You can start painting on any wall You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall But we are not only tracking one finger, here"
617,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," The camera is actually doing — just, getting all the images — is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside So, technically, it's a little bit complex, but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside"
618,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," (Applause) Thank you And later I can find a wall, anywhere, and start browsing those photos or maybe, ""OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend"" So, we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world And, of course, if you don't have any surface, you can start using your palm for simple operations Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand"
619,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," For example, in this case, the book cover is matched with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online, and checking out which book it is Once it has that information, it finds out more reviews about that, or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that, so you can actually hear, on a physical book, a review as sound (Video) Famous talk at Harvard University — This was Obama's visit last week to MIT"
620,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated You have to check your computer in order to do that, right? (Applause) When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon And I think this technology will not only change the way — (Laughter) Yes"
621,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," The fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro, and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right? (Laughter) And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life But many of you argue, actually, that all of our work is not only about physical objects"
622,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," So, rather than waiting for that, I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper So, what I did here is remove the camera — All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera I removed the microphone from that, and then just pinched that — like I just made a clip out of the microphone — and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around"
623,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving You can of course watch movies (Video) Good afternoon My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54"" PM: And you can of course play games (Car engine) Here, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game (Applause) Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse Yeah"
624,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," So, more interestingly, I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer (Applause) And why only computers? We can just play with papers Paper world is interesting to play with"
625,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Yeah And I say, ""OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing"" So I now have a print-out of that thing So the workflow is more intuitive, the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back, rather than now switching between these two worlds"
626,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines That's all Thank you (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Chris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius This is incredible, really"
627,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Companies like mobile-phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India, thinking, ""Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'? We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system"
628,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," We will provide all the open source software for them, maybe starting next month CA: Open source? Wow (Applause) CA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point? PM: Yeah Yes, yes, of course CA: What are your plans? MIT? India? How are you going to split your time going forward? PM: There is a lot of energy here Lots of learning All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India"
629,The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology,Pranav Mistry,"['design', 'technology']"," Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000? I showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time, and then he said, ""OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that"" So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment"

Home The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture, what made our society That is not happening anymore"
642,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now; the Edwards family (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early How are you feeling? Stacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now"

Who invented it? What's the purpose of school? School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc, etc"
644,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," So you could say that school food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances (Laughter) Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for — (Laughter) I need to say one thing, and it's so important in, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America — I offer myself as their ambassador I'm not slagging them off They're doing the best they can do"
645,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being told to do is wrong The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business There's a problem: If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive and write different things around things"
646,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get every day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough fresh food in there at all You know, the amount of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe — there's not enough veggies at all French fries are considered a vegetable Pizza for breakfast They don't even get crockery Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous"
647,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff (Sighs) Ten percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double We're not teaching our kids"

I want to talk about something so basic as milk Every kid has the right to milk at school"
650,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," But milk ain't good enough anymore Don't get me wrong, I support milk — but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it Yeah Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well"
651,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," Okay? There's sugar in everything I know the ins and outs of those ingredients It's in everything Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems There's our milk There's our carton In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop, and they are having two a day So, let me just show you We've got one kid, here — having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day You know, there's your week There's your month"
652,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics and the evidence, and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse That's my belief (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me This, all this bad news, is preventable"

Week in, week out How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket? Love them They just sell us what we want All right They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket They need to help us shop They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy This is not expensive"
655,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education at the heart of their businesses I know, easier said than done It's the future It's the only way Fast food With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive I've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants I know how they do it"
656,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted OK, school"
657,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," Life skills (Applause) That means that they can be students, young parents, and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking, no matter what recession hits them next time If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter If you can cook, time doesn't matter The workplace, we haven't really talked about it You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff"

661,Teach every child about food,Jamie Oliver,"['business', 'global issues', 'health']"," There are angels around America doing great things in schools — farm-to-school set-ups, garden set-ups, education — there are amazing people doing this already The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they're already doing, and doing well"

663,How to start a movement,Derek Sivers,"['business', 'entertainment']","Ladies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed What he's doing is so easy to follow Here's his first follower with a crucial role; he's going to show everyone else how to follow"
664,How to start a movement,Derek Sivers,"['business', 'entertainment']"," Now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural Now, there he is calling to his friends Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself It takes guts to stand out like that The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader (Laughter) (Applause) And here comes a second follower Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts — three is a crowd, and a crowd is news"
665,How to start a movement,Derek Sivers,"['business', 'entertainment']"," It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader Now, here come two more people, and immediately after, three more people Now we've got momentum This is the tipping point Now we've got a movement (Laughter) So, notice that, as more people join in, it's less risky So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to"
666,How to start a movement,Derek Sivers,"['business', 'entertainment']"," (Laughter) So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in And that's how you make a movement But let's recap some lessons from this So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement, not you"
667,How to start a movement,Derek Sivers,"['business', 'entertainment']"," The biggest lesson, if you noticed — did you catch it? — is that leadership is over-glorified Yes, it was the shirtless guy who was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader So, as we're told that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow"
668,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business'],"How do you explain when things don't go as we assume? Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions? For example: Why is Apple so innovative? Year after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition And yet, they're just a computer company They're just like everyone else"
669,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Then why is it that they seem to have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement? He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day"
670,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," There's something else at play here About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it As it turns out, there's a pattern"
671,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," And it's the complete opposite to everyone else All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea I call it the golden circle Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't Let me define the terms really quickly Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent"
672,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do And by ""why"" I don't mean ""to make a profit"" That's a result It's always a result By ""why,"" I mean: What's your purpose? What's your cause? What's your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? As a result, the way we think, we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious"
673,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations — regardless of their size, regardless of their industry — all think, act and communicate from the inside out Let me give you an example I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: ""We make great computers They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly"
674,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business'],""" That's how most of us communicate That's how most marketing and sales are done, that's how we communicate interpersonally We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats Buy our car"
675,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Here's how Apple actually communicates ""Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo We believe in thinking differently The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly We just happen to make great computers Want to buy one?"" Totally different, right? You're ready to buy a computer from me I just reversed the order of the information"
676,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple As I said before, Apple's just a computer company Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products In fact, they tried"
677,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs They've been making flat-screen monitors for years Nobody bought one Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products — and nobody bought one In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell Why would you buy one from a computer company? But we do it every day"
678,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe Here's the best part: None of what I'm telling you is my opinion It's all grounded in the tenets of biology Not psychology, biology"
679,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the ""what"" level The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language"
680,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," It just doesn't drive behavior When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do This is where gut decisions come from Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, ""I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right"
681,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," The best we can muster up is, ""I don't know It just doesn't feel right"" Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language"
682,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears"
683,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day Everybody was trying it And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success"
684,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," It's always the same three things, so let's explore that Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine Money was no problem He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic"
685,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley? A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur And The New York Times followed them around nowhere"
686,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world Samuel Pierpont Langley was different He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous He was in pursuit of the result He was in pursuit of the riches And lo and behold, look what happened The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears The others just worked for the paycheck"
687,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it We found out about it a few days later And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: the day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit He could have said, ""That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology,"" but he didn't"
688,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it If you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe? Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, if you don't know the law, you know the terminology The first 25% of our population are our innovators The next 135% of our population are our early adopters"
689,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore (Laughter) We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips"
690,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers We all have about 10% who just ""get it"" That's how we describe them, right? That's like that gut feeling, ""Oh, they just get it"
691,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters, they're comfortable making those gut decisions They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week"
692,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves It's because they wanted to be first People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe"
693,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation First, the famous failure It's a commercial example As we said before, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions You should have success then Look at TiVo"
694,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," They were extremely well-funded Market conditions were fantastic I mean, we use TiVo as verb I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time (Laughter) But TiVo's a commercial failure They've never made money And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10 In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes"
695,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," They said, ""We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking"" And the cynical majority said, ""We don't believe you We don't need it We don't like it You're scaring us"" What if they had said, ""If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you"
696,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business'],", etc"" People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr King speak They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date How do you do that? Well, Dr"
697,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America In fact, some of his ideas were bad But he had a gift He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America He went around and told people what he believed ""I believe, I believe, I believe,"" he told people And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people"
698,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak How many of them showed up for him? Zero They showed up for themselves It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white: 25% of the audience was white Dr"
699,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life We followed, not for him, but for ourselves By the way, he gave the ""I have a dream"" speech, not the ""I have a plan"" speech (Laughter) Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans"
700,How great leaders inspire action,Simon Sinek,['business']," Because there are leaders and there are those who lead Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us Whether they're individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves And it's those who start with ""why"" that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them Thank you very much"
701,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']","So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem"
702,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," The numbers tell the story quite clearly 190 heads of state — nine are women Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats — tops out at 15, 16 percent The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent"
703,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," A recent study in the US showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture"
704,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any And so I said, ""Did you just move into this office?"" And he said, ""No, we've been here about a year"" And I said, ""Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?"" And he looked at me, and he said, ""Yeah"
705,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']",""" (Laughter) So the question is, how are we going to fix this? How do we change these numbers at the top? How do we make this different? I want to start out by saying, I talk about this — about keeping women in the workforce — because I really think that's the answer"
706,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals"
707,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," I don't have the right answer I don't even have it for myself I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, ""Mommy, don't get on the plane"" thing This is hard I feel guilty sometimes"
708,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three One, sit at the table Two, make your partner a real partner And three, don't leave before you leave Number one: sit at the table"
709,Why we have too few women leaders,Sheryl Sandberg,"['business', 'technology']"," And everyone kind of sat at the table He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, ""Sit at the table Come on, sit at the table,"" and they sat on the side of the room When I was in college, my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History Don't you love that kind of thing from college? I wish I could do that now"

738,The power of vulnerability,Brené Brown,"['communication', 'culture', 'social change']"," But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to — and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories — thousands of pieces of data in six years And I kind of got a handle on it"
739,The power of vulnerability,Brené Brown,"['communication', 'culture', 'social change']"," I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay — and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness — that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness — they have a strong sense of love and belonging — and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough"

744,The power of vulnerability,Brené Brown,"['communication', 'culture', 'social change']"," The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating — as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing They just talked about it being necessary They talked about the willingness to say, ""I love you"" first "

Because he was out standing in his field (Laughter) I'm sorry Okay, so these are three things I know to be true But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding So I write poems to figure things out Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem"
768,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," Spoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person When I was a freshman in high school, I was a live wire of nervous hormones And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long, I was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry"
769,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," So I decided to give it a try My first spoken-word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine The poem was very indignant, and mainly exaggerated, but the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant, so I thought that's what was expected of me"
770,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," I felt this tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand, but instead she just nodded at me and said, ""Hey, I really felt that Thanks"" And lightning struck I was hooked"
771,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," I was the youngest by at least a decade, but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about In fact, they welcomed me And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories, that I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly"
772,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," Never mind the fact that I was 14 They told me, ""Write about being 14"" So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant, grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me, ""Hey, I really felt that too"" Now I can divide my spoken-word journey into three steps Step one was the moment I said, ""I can I can do this"" And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie Step two was the moment I said, ""I will"
773,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," I love spoken word I will keep coming back week after week"" And step three began when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems, if that's not what I was There were things that were specific to me, and the more that I focused on those things, the weirder my poetry got, but the more that it felt like mine It's not just the adage ""Write what you know"
774,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand, but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been When I got to university, I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken-word poetry And actually, Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name When I was in high school I had created Project VOICE as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me"
775,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment'],"OICE, this time changing the mission to using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain, educate and inspire We stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled, performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates, from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus And we saw over and over the way that spoken-word poetry cracks open locks But it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary"
776,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," So I came up with lists Everyone can write lists And the first list that I assign is ""10 Things I Know to be True"" And here's what happens, you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud At a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing, or one thing very similar, to something on your list And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours"
777,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," Fourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about, but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it And I tell people that this is where great stories start from — these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in And most people respond really well to this exercise But one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte, was not convinced"
778,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," ""Miss,"" she'd say, ""I'm just not interesting I don't have anything interesting to say"" So I assigned her list after list, and one day I assigned the list ""10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now"" Number three on Charlotte's list was, ""I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age"" I asked her what that meant, and she said, ""Miss, it's kind of a long story"" And I said, ""Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me"
779,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," And the poem began, ""Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man"" (Laughter) ""Did you see him on 60 Minutes, racing Michael Phelps in a pool — nothing but swim trunks on — diving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion?

780,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up But I try to walk through life like this And yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt, but it also means that when beautiful, amazing things just fall out of the sky, I'm ready to catch them"
781,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," It's not that I think that spoken-word poetry is the ideal art form I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems But I teach spoken-word poetry because it's accessible Not everyone can read music or owns a camera, but everyone can communicate in some way, and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from Plus, spoken-word poetry allows for immediate connection"
782,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared And that is an amazing realization to have, especially when you're 14 Plus, now with YouTube, that connection's not even limited to the room we're in I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to"
783,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself And that is step three: infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you, even while those things are always changing Because step three never ends But you don't get to start on step three, until you take step one first: ""I can"
784,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," I watched her realize that, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing, she can create poems that only Charlotte can write, about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell — like this story"
785,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club, but it's possible that it was much earlier In preparing for TED, I discovered this diary page in an old journal I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th It's clear that when I was a child, I definitely walked through life like this I think that we all did"
786,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," So I'd like to close with this poem When they bombed Hiroshima, the explosion formed a mini-supernova, so every living animal, human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash And what was left of the city soon followed The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder"
787,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment'],""" She says I have old eyes When my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old, but I took my mom by the hand and told her, ""Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby"" And yet, for someone who's apparently done this already, I still haven't figured anything out yet My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage My self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry, and it still always tastes funny in my mouth"
788,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets, I keep trying, hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed My parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name In the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible, and — she laughed, because the first Sarah, she didn't know what to do with impossible"
789,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," Impossible is trying to connect in this world, trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you, knowing that while you're speaking, they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk — they hear you They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth — that impossible connection There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation"
790,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light After the A-bomb, specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again But that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth When I meet you, in that moment, I'm no longer a part of your future I start quickly becoming part of your past But in that instant, I get to share your present"
791,If I should have a daughter ...,Sarah Kay,['entertainment']," And that is the greatest present of all So if you tell me I can do the impossible — I'll probably laugh at you I don't know if I can change the world yet, because I don't know that much about it — and I don't know that much about reincarnation either, but if you make me laugh hard enough, sometimes I forget what century I'm in This isn't my first time here This isn't my last time here These aren't the last words I'll share"
792,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity'],"First, a video Yes, it is a scrambled egg But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated And now they're going to be poured back into the egg And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works"
793,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things, such as chickens And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity In fact, this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy"
794,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And that's why that video feels a bit strange And yet, look around us What we see around us is staggering complexity Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone, there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth"
795,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," So here's a great puzzle: in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics, how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described, the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center? Well, the answer seems to be, the universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty"
796,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And slightly more complex things appear And where you have slightly more complex things, you can get slightly more complex things And in this way, complexity builds stage by stage Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments And at each threshold, the going gets tougher"
797,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," Now, we, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law, and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility And that's the story that we tell in big history But to do it, you have do something that may, at first sight, seem completely impossible You have to survey the whole history of the universe So let's do it"
798,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity'],"7 billion years, to the beginning of time Around us, there's nothing There's not even time or space Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are And then suddenly, bang! A universe appears, an entire universe And we've crossed our first threshold The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom It's incredibly hot"
799,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And it's expanding at incredible speed And at first, it's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter — quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons And all of that happens in the first second"
800,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage We know above all that it was extremely simple It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms, and they have no structure They're really a sort of cosmic mush"
801,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background What you see here, the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity And this is how it works Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff"
802,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds And each cloud is compacted, gravity gets more powerful as density increases, the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud, and then, at the center, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees, protons start to fuse, there's a huge release of energy, and — bam! We have our first stars"
803,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds When very large stars die, they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring, it was forged in a supernova explosion So now the universe is chemically more complex"
804,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And what starts happening is that, around young suns, young stars, all these elements combine, they swirl around, the energy of the star stirs them around, they form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes, they form rocks, they form asteroids, and eventually, they form planets and moons And that is how our solar system was formed, four and a half billion years ago"
805,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity Now, the going gets tougher The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile, significantly more vulnerable, but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking, of course, about living organisms Living organisms are created by chemistry We are huge packages of chemicals"
806,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," That operates over smaller scales than gravity, which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry? What are the Goldilocks conditions? Well, first, you need energy, but not too much In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again But not too little In intergalactic space, there's so little energy that atoms can't combine"
807,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," You also need a great diversity of chemical elements, and you need liquids, such as water Why? Well, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up In solids, atoms are stuck together, they can't move In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules Now, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions? Well, planets are great, and our early Earth was almost perfect"
808,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And deep beneath those oceans, at cracks in the Earth's crust, you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth, and you've got a great diversity of elements So at those deep oceanic vents, fantastic chemistry began to happen, and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations But of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry"
809,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," You don't stabilize the individual; you stabilize the template, the thing that carries information, and you allow the template to copy itself And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule that contains that information You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA Each rung contains information So, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms And DNA also copies itself"
810,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," So the information spreads Notice that information has become part of our story The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections As it copies itself, once in every billion rungs, there tends to be an error And what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity"
811,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," For most of that time of life on Earth, living organisms have been relatively simple — single cells But they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago, multi-celled organisms appear You get fungi, you get fish, you get plants, you get amphibia, you get reptiles, and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs And occasionally, there are disasters"
812,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," Terrible news for the dinosaurs, but great news for our mammalian ancestors, who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story Let me explain why We've seen that DNA learns in a sense, it accumulates information"
813,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," DNA accumulates information through random errors, some of which just happen to work But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning: it had produced organisms with brains, and those organisms can learn in real time They accumulate information, they learn The sad thing is, when they die, the information dies with them Now what makes humans different is human language"
814,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information, and it can accumulate from generation to generation And that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful, and that's why we have a history We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning It's what makes us different We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history"
815,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," Each migration involved learning — learning new ways of exploiting the environment, new ways of dealing with their surroundings Then 10,000 years ago, exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age, humans learned to farm Farming was an energy bonanza And exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied Human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected"
816,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," And that brain is learning at warp speed And in the last 200 years, something else has happened We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us So — Here we are, back at the convention center We've been on a journey, a return journey, of 137 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story"
817,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," But it also contains warnings Collective learning is a very, very powerful force, and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England, living through the Cuban Missile Crisis For a few days, the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction And the same weapons are still here, and they are still armed If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us"
818,The history of our world in 18 minutes,David Christian,['humanity']," So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning And now, finally — this is what I want I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends and his generation, throughout the world, to know the story of big history, and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us"
819,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business'],"Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft Imagine a plane full of smoke Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack It sounds scary Well, I had a unique seat that day I was sitting in 1D I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants So I looked at them right away, and they said, ""No problem We probably hit some birds"" The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far You could see Manhattan"
820,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business']," The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River That's usually not the route (Laughter) He turns off the engines Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound And then he says three words The most unemotional three words I've ever heard He says, ""Brace for impact"" I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore (Laughter) I could see in her eyes, it was terror Life was over"
821,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business']," I learned that it all changes in an instant We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, ""I collect bad wines"" Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it"
822,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business']," And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life The second thing I learned that day — and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot — (Laughter) I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret I've lived a good life In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in"
823,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business']," And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life It's not perfect, but it's a lot better I've not had a fight with my wife in two years It feels great I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy The third thing I learned — and this is as your mental clock starts going, ""15, 14, 13"" You can see the water coming"
824,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business'],""" I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives But it was very sad I didn't want to go; I love my life And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing I only wish I could see my kids grow up"
825,3 things I learned while my plane crashed,Ric Elias,['business']," And it made all the sense in the world to me I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently"
826,Try something new for 30 days,Matt Cutts,['culture'],"A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days The idea is actually pretty simple Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit — like watching the news — from your life"
827,Try something new for 30 days,Matt Cutts,['culture']," The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work"
828,Try something new for 30 days,Matt Cutts,['culture']," Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month"
829,Try something new for 30 days,Matt Cutts,['culture']," By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel Now is my book the next great American novel? No I wrote it in a month It's awful (Laughter) But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, ""I'm a computer scientist"" No, no, if I want to, I can say, ""I'm a novelist"
830,Try something new for 30 days,Matt Cutts,['culture']," I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges In fact, they're a ton of fun But they're less likely to stick When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this"
831,A robot that flies like a bird,Markus Fischer,"['design', 'technology']","It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird Birds are very agile They fly, not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings So we looked at the birds, and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight, and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings"
832,A robot that flies like a bird,Markus Fischer,"['design', 'technology']"," There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics, in the field of building gliders And the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly over your heads So be careful later on (Laughter) And this was one issue: to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down"
833,A robot that flies like a bird,Markus Fischer,"['design', 'technology']"," So I now would like you to put your seat belts on and put your hats on So maybe we'll try it once — to fly a SmartBird Thank you (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Applause ends) (Applause) So we can now look at the SmartBird So here is one without a skin We have a wingspan of about two meters The length is one meter and six, and the weight is only 450 grams And it is all out of carbon fiber"
834,A robot that flies like a bird,Markus Fischer,"['design', 'technology']"," So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors, so we know exactly where the wing is And if we now beat up and down — (Mechanical sounds) We have the possibility to fly like a bird So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion, and if you go up, the wings are not that large, and it is easier to get up So, the next thing we did, or the challenges we did, was to coordinate this movement We have to turn it, go up and go down"
835,A robot that flies like a bird,Markus Fischer,"['design', 'technology']"," With the split wing, we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion, from 30 percent up to 80 percent Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure"
836,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']","We are losing our listening We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it We retain just 25 percent of what we hear Now — not you, not this talk, but that is generally true (Laughter) Let's define listening as making meaning from sound It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction We use some pretty cool techniques to do this One of them is pattern recognition"
837,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name Differencing is another technique we use If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes, (Pink noise) you would literally cease to hear it We listen to differences; we discount sounds that remain the same And then there is a whole range of filters These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to"
838,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," But they actually create our reality in a way, because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now I'll give you one example of that Intention is very important in sound, in listening When I married my wife, I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis (Laughter) But it's a great intention to have in a relationship (Laughter) But that's not all"
839,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," If you close your eyes right now in this room, you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces; you're aware of how many people are around you, because of the micro-noises you're receiving And sound places us in time as well, because sound always has time embedded in it In fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future"
840,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening Why did I say that? Well, there are a lot of reasons for this First of all, we invented ways of recording — first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared Secondly, the world is now so noisy, (Noise) with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily, it's just hard to listen; it's tiring to listen"
841,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," In this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody We're becoming impatient We don't want oratory anymore; we want sound bites And the art of conversation is being replaced — dangerously, I think — by personal broadcasting I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation, which is sadly very common, especially in the UK We're becoming desensitized"
842,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet, the subtle, the understated This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening This is not trivial, because listening is our access to understanding Conscious listening always creates understanding, and only without conscious listening can these things happen A world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed"
843,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," Would you like that? Audience: Yes! Good The first one is silence Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate, so that you can hear the quiet again If you can't get absolute silence, go for quiet, that's absolutely fine Second, I call this ""the mixer"
844,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," How many birds am I hearing? Where are they? Where are those ripples? It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening Third, this exercise I call ""savoring,"" and this is a beautiful exercise It's about enjoying mundane sounds This, for example, is my tumble dryer (Dryer) It's a waltz — one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three I love it! Or just try this one on for size"
845,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," I call that the ""hidden choir"" — it's around us all the time The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these, if you just take one thing away This is listening positions — the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to This is playing with those filters"
846,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," These are just some of the listening positions, or scales of listening positions, that you can use There are many Have fun with that It's very exciting And finally, an acronym You can use this in listening, in communication If you're in any one of those roles — and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk — the acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for ""juice"" or ""essence"
847,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," Now sound is my passion, it's my life I wrote a whole book about it So I live to listen That's too much to ask for most people But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully — connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritually connected, because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart"
848,5 ways to listen better,Julian Treasure,"['culture', 'social change']"," Why is it not taught? It's crazy And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about, and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time, or at least capable of doing it Now, I don't know how to do that, but this is TED, and I think the TED community is capable of anything"
849,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']","Okay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar We're all liars"
850,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote this book, ""Liespotting,"" no one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no They say, ""It's okay, we'll email you"" (Laughter) I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks My husband's like, ""Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking"
851,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room that are shouting, ""Gotcha! Gotcha!

852,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act Think about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to Truth number one about lying: Lying's a cooperative act"
853,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret We say, ""Nice song"" ""Honey, you don't look fat in that, no"" Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, ""You know, I just fished that email out of my Spam folder So sorry"" But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception And that can have dramatic costs for us"

856,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," We wish we were better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer — the list goes on Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were, how we wish we could be, with what we're really like And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times"
857,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other (Laughter) Now when we first hear this data, we recoil We can't believe how prevalent lying is We're essentially against lying But if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers Extroverts lie more than introverts"

862,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," It's been very confusing for a long time now What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time The rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars There are no real original liars We all make the same mistakes We all use the same techniques"

870,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky"
871,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours, they will ask that person to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells Why do they do that? Well, we all do the same thing"

875,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," Now with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship But when anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed It's associated with moral superiority And for that reason, it's very, very hard to recover from Here's what it looks like It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in It's the only asymmetrical expression"
876,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap Thank you"" Science has surfaced many, many more indicators We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower Now here's the deal These behaviors are just behaviors"

880,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," And that — maybe it'll fade too with time — but I don't think so That bothers me the most PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression of a mother's agony"

884,How to spot a liar,Pamela Meyer,"['culture', 'science', 'society']"," So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, ""Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one"

(Applause) (Applause ends) And his equipment as well Yves, welcome It is quite amazing Those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities And there were many, many others So it's possible to fly almost like a bird What is it like to be up there? Yves Rossy: It's fun It's fun (Laughter) I don't have feathers But I feel like a bird sometimes"
889,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," And when I strap just this little harness, this little wing, I really have the feeling of being a bird BG: How did you start to become Jetman? YR: It was about 20 years ago, when I discovered free falling When you go out of an airplane, you are almost naked You take a position like that And especially when you take a tracking position, you have the feeling that you are flying And that's the nearest thing to the dream"
890,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," You are just in the element It's very short and only in one direction (Laughter) So the idea was, okay, keep that feeling of freedom, but change the vector and increase the time BG: So I'm kind of curious, what's your top speed? YR: It's about 300 km per hour before looping That means about 190 miles per hour BG: What's the weight of the equipment you're carrying? YR: When I exit full of kerosene, I'm about 55 kilos I have 55 kilos on my back"
891,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement And it's really like the kid playing the airplane I want to go down like that And up I climb, I turn It's really pure flying It's not steering, it's flight BG: What kind of training do you do, you personally, for that? YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit I don't do special physical training I just try to keep my mobility through new activities For example, last winter I began with kite surfing"
892,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," So you have to adapt I'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot, but this is, really — You need fluidity, you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast BG: Somebody in the audience asked me, ""How does he breathe up there?"" Because you're going fast and you're up at 3,000 meters or so YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters, it's not such a big problem with oxygen But for example, bikers, they have the same speed"
893,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," BG: Describe for me the equipment, since you have it here So Breitling's four engines YR: Yeah, two-meter span Ultra-stable profile Four little engines, 22 kilos thrust each, turbines, working with kerosene Harness, parachute My only instruments are an altimeter and time I know I have about eight minutes fuel So I just check before it's finished (Laughter) And yeah, that's all Two parachutes"
894,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," And this is my life That's the real important thing about safety I did use that during these last 15 years about 20 times Never with that type of wing, but at the beginning I can release my wing when I am in a spin or unstable BG: We saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean So that was one of those cases where you let the wings go, right? YR: Yeah"
895,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," So I did try to take, again, a climb altitude I thought, okay, I will go out But most probably, I did something like that (Laughter) BG: Something that is not very safe, the image YR: You feel great, but — (Laughter) But you have not the right altitude So the next thing I saw was just blue It was the sea I have also an audible altimeter So I was at my minimum altitude in that vector — fast — so I pulled that And then I did open my chute"
896,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," YR: Exactly There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons: so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that, just on his head BG: I see Maybe come back here This is risky stuff indeed People have died trying to do this kind of thing And you don't look like a crazy guy; you're a Swiss airline pilot, so you're rather a checklist kind of guy I assume you have standards YR: Yeah I have no checklist for that"
897,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," (Laughter) YR: No, that's really two worlds Civil aviation is something that we know very well We have a hundred years of experience And you can adapt really precisely With that, I have to adapt to something new That means improvise So it's really a play between these two approaches Something that I know very well, these principles For example, we have two engines on an Airbus; with only one engine, you can fly it So plan B, always a plan B"
898,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," That's my ejection seat So I have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of Mother Nature BG: It's well said What happens if one of the engines stops? YR: I do a roll And then I stabilize, and according to my altitude, I continue on two or three engines It's sometimes possible"
899,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," BG: So the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter, and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines, and then you basically take off mid-air somewhere And then the landing, as we have seen, arriving on this side of the Channel, is through a parachute So just as a curiosity, where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon? Did you land on the rim, down at the bottom? YR: It was down on the bottom"
900,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," But it was too stony and full of cactus on top (Laughter) BG: That's exactly why I asked the question YR: And also, the currents are quite funny there There is big thermal activity, big difference in altitude also So it was much safer for me to land at the bottom BG: I think that right now, many people are asking, ""When are you developing a double-seater so they can fly with you?"" YR: I have a standard answer"
901,Fly with the Jetman,Yves Rossy,"['design', 'technology']"," (Applause) (Applause ends) BG: Yves, one last question What's next for you? What's next for Jetman? YR: First, to instruct a younger guy I want to share it, to do formation flights And I plan to start from a cliff, like catapulted from a cliff BG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?

921,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause (Laughter) We're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time I applied to Harvard on a dare"
922,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go Something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you, I felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom"
923,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," (Laughter) I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years And in my research and my teaching, I found that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or physics, but on the competition, the workload, the hassles, stresses, complaints"
924,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," When they'd visit, they'd look around, and say, ""This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's"" It does, because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard And when they see this, they say, ""Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard? What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?"" Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness"
925,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," 90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world And if we change it, if we change our formula for happiness and success, we can change the way that we can then affect reality"
926,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," I talked to a New England boarding school, probably the most prestigious one, and they said, ""We already know that So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week And we're so excited Monday night we have the world's leading expert will speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying Wednesday night is eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug use"
927,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']",""" (Laughter) I said, ""That's most people's Friday nights"" (Laughter) (Applause) Which I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all Silence on the phone And into the silence, I said, ""I'd be happy to speak at your school, but that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week You've outlined all the negative things that can happen, but not talked about the positive"" The absence of disease is not health"
928,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," In the last three years, I've traveled to 45 countries, working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful And if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior"
929,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change it And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there"
930,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," And that's because we think we have to be successful, then we'll be happier But our brains work in the opposite order If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise"
931,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed You're 37% better at sales Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed Which means we can reverse the formula"
932,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of Because dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive, has two functions Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way We've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive"
933,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," We've done these things in research now in every company that I've worked with, getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row, three new things each day And at the end of that, their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it"
934,The happy secret to better work,Shawn Achor,"['business', 'science', 'health', 'innovation', 'social change']"," We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network"
935,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']","When I was nine years old, I went off to summer camp for the first time And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social"
936,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better (Laughter) I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns (Laughter) Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit"
937,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie"" (Laughter) Yeah So I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell this word incorrectly (Laughter) But I recited a cheer I recited a cheer along with everybody else I did my best And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books"
938,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And then the second time I tried it, the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing And so I put my books away, back in their suitcase, and I put them under my bed, and there they stayed for the rest of the summer And I felt kind of guilty about this"
939,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer Now, I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you 50 others just like it — all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert"
940,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," But for years I denied this intuition, and so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things, instead of the writer that I had always longed to be — partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends"
941,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Now this is what many introverts do, and it's our loss for sure, but it is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best A third to a half of the population are introverts — a third to a half So that's one out of every two or three people you know"
942,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing Now, to see the bias clearly, you need to understand what introversion is It's different from being shy Shyness is about fear of social judgment Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation"
943,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Not all the time — these things aren't absolute — but a lot of the time So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us But now here's where the bias comes in Our most important institutions, our schools and our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation"
944,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays: When I was going to school, we sat in rows We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work pretty autonomously But nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks — four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other And kids are working in countless group assignments"
945,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone, those kids are seen as outliers often or, worse, as problem cases And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert, even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable, according to research (Laughter) Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces"
946,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions, even though introverts tend to be very careful, much less likely to take outsize risks — which is something we might all favor nowadays"
947,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi — all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy And they all took the spotlight, even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to"
948,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts, including my beloved husband And we all fall at different points, of course, along the introvert/extrovert spectrum Even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms, said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert"
949,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and we call these people ambiverts And I often think that they have the best of all worlds But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other And what I'm saying is that culturally, we need a much better balance We need more of a yin and yang between these two types"
950,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity So Darwin, he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner-party invitations Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr Seuss, he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla, California"
951,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']", Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up
952,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it If you look at most of the world's major religions, you will find seekers — Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad — seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness, where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community"
953,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," This is no surprise, though, if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to, you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that's what you're doing"
954,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," So — (Laughter) You might be following the person with the best ideas, but you might not And do you really want to leave it up to chance? Much better for everybody to go off by themselves, generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics, and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there"
955,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Western societies, and in particular the US, have always favored the man of action over the ""man"" of contemplation But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character, where we still, at that point, valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like ""Character, the Grandest Thing in the World"
956,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Ralph Waldo Emerson called him ""A man who does not offend by superiority"" But then we hit the 20th century, and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities"
957,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," So, quite understandably, qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important And sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" And they feature as their role models really great salesmen So that's the world we're living in today That's our cultural inheritance"
958,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']", The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together
959,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today Guess what? Books I have a suitcase full of books Here's Margaret Atwood, ""Cat's Eye"" Here's a novel by Milan Kundera And here's ""The Guide for the Perplexed"" by Maimonides But these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors"
960,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," I mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books Just like the rest of my family, my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read But he also loved his congregation, and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi"
961,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," And people would come from all over to hear him speak But here's the thing about my grandfather Underneath this ceremonial role, he was really modest and really introverted — so much so that when he delivered these sermons, he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years"
962,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," But when he died at the age of 94, the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way So I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write And for me, that seven years was like total bliss, because I was reading, I was writing, I was thinking, I was researching"
963,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," But now all of a sudden my job is very different, and my job is to be out here talking about it, talking about introversion (Laughter) And that's a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now, this is not my natural milieu So I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get And I call this my ""year of speaking dangerously"
964,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," But I'll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude, we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change I mean, we are And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision Number one: Stop the madness for constant group work Just stop it (Laughter) Thank you"
965,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," That is great It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work School, same thing We need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure, but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own This is especially important for extroverted children too They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part"
966,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Be like Buddha, have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again, but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often Number three: Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there So extroverts, maybe your suitcases are also full of books"
967,The power of introverts,Susan Cain,"['business', 'culture']"," Whatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy But introverts, you being you, you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase And that's okay But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see, because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry"
968,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science'],"On a typical day at school, endless hours are spent learning the answers to questions, but right now, we'll do the opposite We're going to focus on questions where you can't learn the answers because they're unknown"
969,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Someone must know, right? Guess what? No one knows Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever But diving into them is exciting because it takes you to the edge of knowledge, and you never know what you'll find there So, two questions that no one on Earth knows the answer to"
970,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it: the Sun It seems impossibly big But in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale white mist stretched across the sky And it gets worse There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes"
971,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total"
972,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies We can think of them as part of our universe They make up a single, giant edifice obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos, that make up you and me"
973,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond But nonetheless, combined, they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination The leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made up of 10 to the 500 universes"
974,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science'], (Laughter) But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties How's your brain doing? Quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle
975,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams, and in another, not so much Well, there are still some scientists who would say, hogwash The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one Only one universe And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close"
976,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Well, I guess we know one other thing This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen (Music) [Why can't we see evidence of alien life?] Somewhere out there in that vast universe there must surely be countless other planets teeming with life"
977,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," But that leaves a real riddle In the past year, the Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets just around nearby stars And if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be half a trillion planets just in our own galaxy If any one in 10,000 has conditions that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way"
978,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Countless other planets in our galaxy should have formed earlier, and given life a chance to get underway billions, or certainly many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth If just a few of them had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power On Earth, we've seen how dramatically technology can accelerate in just 100 years"
979,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," At the very least, you'd think they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals of one kind or another And yet we see no convincing evidence of any of it Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark Maybe a single, superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid of any potential competitors"
980,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Or maybe they're not that intelligent, or perhaps the evolution of an intelligence capable of creating sophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed After all, it's only happened once on Earth in four billion years Maybe even that was incredibly lucky Maybe we are the first such civilization in our galaxy"
981,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," But there are numerous more hopeful answers For a start, we're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful amount of money on it Only a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely for signs of interesting signals And perhaps we're not looking the right way Maybe as civilizations develop, they quickly discover communication technologies far more sophisticated and useful than electromagnetic waves"
982,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Or, maybe we're looking at the wrong scale Perhaps intelligent civilizations come to realize that life is ultimately just complex patterns of information interacting with each other in a beautiful way, and that that can happen more efficiently at a small scale"
983,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," So the Solar System might be teeming with aliens, and we're just not noticing them Maybe the very ideas in our heads are a form of alien life Well, okay, that's a crazy thought The aliens made me say it But it is cool that ideas do seem to have a life all of their own and that they outlive their creators Maybe biological life is just a passing phase"
984,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," And meanwhile, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists, maybe including you, can bring the power of the crowd to join the search And here on Earth, amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different from the DNA forms we know"
985,Questions no one knows the answers to,Chris Anderson,['science']," Either answer, in its own way, is awe-inspiring, because even if we are alone, the fact that we think and dream and ask these questions might yet turn out to be one of the most important facts about the universe And I have one more piece of good news for you The quest for knowledge and understanding never gets dull It doesn't It's actually the opposite The more you know, the more amazing the world seems"
986,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'],"I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch And when I walked in, she was already at the table I sat down, and she said, ""God, you look like hell"" I said, ""Thanks I feel really — I'm not functioning"
987,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data, as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living, I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown I had a slide that said 'Breakdown' At what point did I think that was a good idea?"" (Laughter) And she said, ""I saw your talk live-streamed It was not really you It was a little different than what you usually do But it was great"" And I said, ""This can't happen"
988,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people"" (Laughter) And she said, ""Well, I think it's too late"" And I said, ""Let me ask you something"" And she said, ""Yeah"" I said, ""Do you remember when we were in college, really wild and kind of dumb?"" She said, ""Yeah"
989,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," no"" (Laughter) Of course, the only thing I could say at that point was, ""Yeah, me neither Yeah — me neither"" And I'm thinking to myself, ""Brené, what are you doing? Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind? Your sisters would be perfect for this"
990,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'],""" (Laughter) She said, ""You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever"" (Laughter) Then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic ""If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over"" (Laughter) I had no contingency plan for four million (Laughter) And my life did end when that happened"
991,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'], But I want to talk about what I've learned There's two things that I've learned in the last year The first is: vulnerability is not weakness And that myth is profoundly dangerous
992,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'],""" How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously? The majority of people Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage? Vulnerability is not weakness I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty It fuels our daily lives"
993,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country — everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies And so many of the calls went like this, ""Dr Brown, we loved your TED talk We'd like you to come in and speak We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame"" (Laughter) What would you like for me to talk about? There's three big answers"
994,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," (Laughter) So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change (Applause) To create is to make something that has never existed before There's nothing more vulnerable than that Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability"
995,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," And I'm going to be really honest with you When I became a ""vulnerability researcher"" and that became the focus because of the TED talk — and I'm not kidding I'll give you an example About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store"
996,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," Our family motto is ""Lock and load"" I am not a natural vulnerability researcher So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six (Laughter) And then I hear, ""Vulnerability TED!"" I turn around, I go, ""Hi"" She's right here and she said, ""You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown"" (Laughter) At this point, parents are, like, pulling their children close (Laughter) ""Look away"
997,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'],""" (Laughter) (Applause) And she looks back and does this, ""I know"" (Laughter) And she said, ""We watched your TED talk in my book club Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes'"" (Laughter) And she said, ""Our tagline is: 'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic'"" (Laughter) You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting"
998,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane ""What do you do?"" ""I study shame"" ""Oh"" (Laughter) And I see you (Laughter) But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule — not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing — ""you've got to dance with the one who brung ya"""
999,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'], I learned about these things from studying shame And so I want to walk you in to shame Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul And we're going to walk in And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there It is to put on some galoshes — and walk through and find our way around Here's why
1000,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," Yes? Cannot have that conversation without shame Because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery, which is, have a checklist"
1001,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," And all-powerful folks don't need checklists And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here Myshkin Ingawale, I hope I did right by you (Applause) I saw the TED Fellows my first day here And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia, because people were dying unnecessarily And he said, ""I saw this need So you know what I did? I made it"
1002,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," (Laughter) And then I made it 32 more times, and then it worked"" You know what the big secret about TED is? I can't wait to tell people this I guess I'm doing it right now (Laughter) This is like the failure conference (Laughter) No, it is (Applause) You know why this place is amazing? Because very few people here are afraid to fail And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed I've failed miserably, many times"
1003,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt A lot of people refer to it as the ""Man in the Arena"" quote And it goes like this: ""It is not the critic who counts It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat"
1004,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture'],""" And that's what this conference, to me, is about Life is about daring greatly, about being in the arena When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door, and you think, ""I'm going in and I'm going to try this,"" shame is the gremlin who says, ""Uh, uh You're not good enough You never finished that MBA Your wife left you I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg, he was in Sing Sing"
1005,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," I know you don't think that you're pretty, smart, talented or powerful enough I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO"" Shame is that thing And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, ""I'm going to do this,"" we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who? Us"
1006,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior Shame is ""I am bad"" Guilt is ""I did something bad"" How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, ""I'm sorry I made a mistake?"" How many of you would be willing to say that? Guilt: I'm sorry I made a mistake Shame: I'm sorry I am a mistake There's a huge difference between shame and guilt And here's what you need to know"
1007,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," And here's what you even need to know more Guilt, inversely correlated with those things The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame"
1008,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli, the commercial ""I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man"
1009,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds (Laughter) Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be And it's a straight-jacket For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations Shame is one, do not be perceived as what? Weak"
1010,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," It wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing, and said, ""I love what say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men"" And I said, ""I don't study men"" And he said, ""That's convenient"" (Laughter) And I said, ""Why?"" And he said, ""Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"" I said, ""Yeah"
1011,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," When we reach out and be vulnerable, we get the shit beat out of us And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else"" So I started interviewing men and asking questions And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work"
1012,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," Shame is an epidemic in our culture And to get out from underneath it — to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College"
1013,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," (Laughter) When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment"
1014,Listening to shame,Brené Brown,['culture']," The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too And so I'll leave you with this thought If we're going to find our way back to each other, vulnerability is going to be that path And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect And that is seductive But the truth is, that never happens"
1015,Beats that defy boxes,Reggie Watts,['entertainment'],"(Non English) (French) Mais Des fois on peut voir parce Que Les gens ici faire Des choses on peut manger (French) Mais quand tu es fâché avec quelqu'un c'est pas passé the first time (British English) And that's one of the things that I enjoy most about this convention It's not so much, as so little has to do with what everything is (Laughter) But it is within our self-interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves"
1016,Beats that defy boxes,Reggie Watts,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Common knowledge, but important nonetheless (Laughter) As we face fear in these times, and fear is all around us, we also have anti-fear It's hard to imagine or measure The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis"

1018,Beats that defy boxes,Reggie Watts,['entertainment']," (Applause) And the computer models, no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use, are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute, and I arrived at a conclusion (Laughter) Tomorrow is another day (Laughter) Not just any day, but it is a day It will get here, there's no question"
1019,Beats that defy boxes,Reggie Watts,['entertainment']," It's believable, it's tactile You can reach out — things are solid You can move objects from one area to another You can feel your body You can say, ""I'd like to go over to this location,"" and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location, at will (Laughter) That's something you live inside of every day"
1020,Beats that defy boxes,Reggie Watts,['entertainment']," (Laughter) So, as I say before the last piece, feel not as though it is a sphere we live on, rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin (Laughter) Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes, it will be plain to see (Laughter) (Audience) (Laughter) This is my final piece"
1021,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],"The story starts: I was at a friend's house, and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual, which is the manual of mental disorders It lists every known mental disorder And it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, and now it's 886 pages long And it lists currently 374 mental disorders So I was leafing through it, wondering if I had any mental disorders, and it turns out I've got 12"
1022,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," I've got nightmare disorder, which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure, and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going, ""You're a failure!"" (Laughter) I've got parent-child relational problems, which I blame my parents for (Laughter) I'm kidding I'm not kidding I'm kidding And I've got malingering"
1023,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was, or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder"
1024,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," (Laughter) It was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies They're called the CCHR And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted?"" And he said, ""Yes, we can prove it to you"" And I said, ""How?"" And he said, ""We're going to introduce you to Tony"" And I said, ""Who's Tony?"" And he said, ""Tony's in Broadmoor"
1025,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane It's where they send the serial killers, and the people who can't help themselves And I said to Brian, ""Well, what did Tony do?"" And he said, ""Hardly anything He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence But he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane"
1026,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],""" So I got the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably And we got to Broadmoor And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients It looks like a giant Hampton Inn It's all peach and pine and calming colors"
1027,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And the patients started drifting in And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants, and quite docile-looking And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me, ""They're medicated,"" which, to the Scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world, but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea (Laughter) And then Brian said, ""Here's Tony"" And a man was walking in And he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape"
1028,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane And he sat down And I said, ""So is it true that you faked your way in here?"" And he said, ""Yep Yep Absolutely I beat someone up when I was 17 And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, 'You know what you have to do? Fake madness"
1029,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," Nurses will bring you pizzas, you'll have your own PlayStation'"" I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"" He said, ""Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls So I said to the psychiatrist, 'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls'"" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah"
1030,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],""" I said, ""Where'd you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library"" Anyway, he faked madness too well, he said And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital They sent him to Broadmoor And the minute he got there, said he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""There's been a terrible misunderstanding I'm not mentally ill"
1031,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years"" Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy He said, ""I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently they had an article about how the US Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives"
1032,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],"S Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?' When I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written: 'Believes bees can sniff out explosives'"" (Laughter) He said, ""You know, they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? It's just impossible"
1033,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening And they take that as a sign of madness They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose"" So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness Anyway, he seemed completely normal to me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden I said, ""What's the story?"" And he said, ""Yep"
1034,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," However, we have assessed him, and we've determined that what he is is a psychopath"" And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath It's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative So, faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong"
1035,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And I said, ""Well, but why didn't he hang out with the other patients?"" Classic psychopath — it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way He was a psychopath"
1036,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],""" So I did I went on a psychopath-spotting course, and I am now a certified — and I have to say, extremely adept — psychopath spotter So, here's the statistics: One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath So there's 1,500 people in his room Fifteen of you are psychopaths Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders, so I think there's a very good chance there's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room"
1037,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," (Laughter) Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior — the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative In fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation of psychopathy It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all Hare said, ""You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness"
1038,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," The big story,"" he said, ""is corporate psychopathy You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths"" So I gave it a try I wrote to the Enron people I said, ""Could I come and interview you in prison, to find out it you're psychopaths?"" (Laughter) And they didn't reply (Laughter) So I changed tack I emailed ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s"
1039,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And I emailed him and I said, ""I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you  special, and interested in the predatory spirit, and fearless Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?"" And he said, ""Come on over!"" (Laughter) So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals"
1040,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],""" It was like Narnia (Laughter) And then we went into his kitchen Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies, he'd close down 30 percent of the workforce And he'd quite often fire people with a joke Like, for instance, one famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said, ""I've just bought myself a new car"" And he said, ""Well, you may have a new car, but I'll tell you what you don't have — a job"
1041,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," You're going where no man has gone before"" And I said, ""Well —"" (Clears throat) (Laughter) Some psychologists might say that this makes you —"" (Mumbles) (Laughter) And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""A psychopath"" And I said, ""I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket Can I go through them with you?"" And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, ""Okay, go on"" And I said, ""Okay Grandiose sense of self-worth"
1042,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," (Laughter) He said, ""Well, you've got to believe in you!"" And I said, ""Manipulative"" He said, ""That's leadership"" (Laughter) And I said, ""Shallow affect, an inability to experience a range of emotions"" He said, ""Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"" So he was going down the psychopath checklist, basically turning it into ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" (Laughter) But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap"
1043,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," He said ""no"" to many short-term marital relationships He's only ever been married twice Admittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument, and his second marriage has lasted 41 years"
1044,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked ""Psychopath"" I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges And I realized, my God — this is what I've been doing for 20 years It's what all journalists do We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands, and we wait for the gems"
1045,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And we stitch them together like medieval monks, and we leave the normal stuff on the floor And you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely Childhood bipolar — children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high on the bipolar checklist When I got back to London, Tony phoned me"
1046,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture'],""" And he said, ""I'm not a psychopath"" He said, ""You know what? One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative So when you say you feel remorse for your crime, they say, 'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't' It's like witchcraft, they turn everything upside-down"" He said, ""I've got a tribunal coming up Will you come to it?"" So I said okay"
1047,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," And after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism So they let him go And outside in the corridor he said to me, ""You know what, Jon? Everyone's a bit psychopathic"" He said, ""You are, I am Well, obviously I am"
1048,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," There's a woman there that I fancy But she's married, so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband"" (Laughter) Anyway, that was two years ago, and that's where my book ended And for the last 20 months, everything was fine Nothing bad happened He was living with a girl outside London He was, according to Brian the Scientologist, making up for lost time, which I know sounds ominous, but isn't necessarily ominous"
1049,Strange answers to the psychopath test,Jon Ronson,['culture']," He got into a ""fracas"" in a bar, he called it Ended up going to jail for a month, which I know is bad, but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was, it wasn't too bad And then he phoned me And you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges And what Tony is, is he's a semi-psychopath He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas"

1053,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," When we think about communication, we think about interactions So what is your body language communicating to me? What's mine communicating to you? And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language, or other people's body language, on judgments And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language"
1054,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued"
1055,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']","S Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes, and even, let's go digital, emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation If you use them poorly, bad idea Right? So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others, how they judge us and what the outcomes are We tend to forget, though, the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves"
1056,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So what nonverbals am I talking about? I'm a social psychologist I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitive business school, so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance? Well, this is what they are So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding"
1057,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," It's about opening up And this is true across the animal kingdom It's not just limited to primates And humans do the same thing (Laughter) So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically, and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are This expression, which is known as pride, Jessica Tracy has studied"
1058,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So when they cross the finish line and they've won, it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it They do this So the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted What do we do when we feel powerless? We do exactly the opposite We close up We wrap ourselves up We make ourselves small We don't want to bump into the person next to us So again, both animals and humans do the same thing"
1059,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals So if someone is being really powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller We don't mirror them We do the opposite of them So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom, and what do I notice? I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals"
1060,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," When they sit down, they're sort of spread out They raise their hands like this You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in As soon they come in, you see it You see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise their hand I notice a couple of things about this One, you're not going to be surprised It seems to be related to gender"
1061,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap"
1062,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating"
1063,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," There's a lot of evidence But our question really was, do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves? There's some evidence that they do So, for example, we smile when we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy So it goes both ways When it comes to power, it also goes both ways"
1064,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So the second question really was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our minds? And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about? So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my case, that's hormones I look at hormones"
1065,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance They also tend to be able to think more abstractly So there are a lot of differences They take more risks There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people Physiologically, there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone"
1066,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So what does that mean? When you think about power, people tended to think only about testosterone, because that was about dominance But really, power is also about how you react to stress So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but really stress reactive? Probably not, right? You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back"
1067,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changes can shape the mind So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention? ""For two minutes,"" you say, ""I want you to stand like this, and it's going to make you feel more powerful"" So this is what we did"
1068,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So here's one A couple more This one has been dubbed the ""Wonder Woman"" by the media Here are a couple more So you can be standing or you can be sitting And here are the low-power poses So you're folding up, you're making yourself small This one is very low-power When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself So this is what happens They come in, they spit into a vial, for two minutes, we say, ""You need to do this or this"
1069,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," We don't want to prime them with a concept of power We want them to be feeling power So two minutes they do this We then ask them, ""How powerful do you feel?"" on a series of items, and then we give them an opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample That's it That's the whole experiment So this is what we find"
1070,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," When you're in the low-power pose condition, only 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference Here's what we find on testosterone From their baseline when they come in, high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase, and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease So again, two minutes, and you get these changes Here's what you get on cortisol"
1071,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable, or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down And we've all had the feeling, right? So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves Also, our bodies change our minds"
1072,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," Where can you actually apply this? Which we cared about, of course And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations, like social threat situations Where are you being evaluated, either by your friends? For teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview"
1073,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview, right? (Laughter) You know, so we were of course horrified, and said, Oh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all For numerous reasons, no, don't do that Again, this is not about you talking to other people It's you talking to yourself What do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this"
1074,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," You're looking at your iPhone — or your Android, not trying to leave anyone out You're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you should be doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right? Do that Find two minutes So that's what we want to test Okay? So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview It's five minutes long"
1075,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," They're being judged also, and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback, so they look like this Imagine this is the person interviewing you So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled People hate this It's what Marianne LaFrance calls ""standing in social quicksand"" So this really spikes your cortisol So this is the job interview we put them through, because we really wanted to see what happened"
1076,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," They're blind to the hypothesis They're blind to the conditions They have no idea who's been posing in what pose, and they end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, ""We want to hire these people,"" all the high-power posers ""We don't want to hire these people We also evaluate these people much more positively overall"" But what's driving it? It's not about the content of the speech"
1077,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech? How good is it? What are their qualifications? No effect on those things This is what's affected These kinds of things People are bringing their true selves, basically They're bringing themselves They bring their ideas, but as themselves, with no, you know, residue over them So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect"
1078,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']",""" Right? So I said, fake it till you make it It's not me I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud I don't want to feel like an impostor I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident"
1079,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," I was thrown from the car And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward, and I had been withdrawn from college, and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations, which was very traumatic I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back They say, ""You're not going to finish college"
1080,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']",""" So I really struggled with this, and I have to say, having your identity taken from you, your core identity, and for me it was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that So I felt entirely powerless I worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked Eventually I graduated from college"
1081,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," I am an impostor And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people That's it I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, ""I'm quitting"" She was like, ""You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do You are going to fake it"
1082,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," You're just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it Like, I have become this I am actually doing this'"" So that's what I did"
1083,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']",""" So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire semester, who I had said, ""Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail,"" came into my office I really didn't know her at all She came in totally defeated, and she said, ""I'm not supposed to be here"" And that was the moment for me Because two things happened One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore"
1084,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," And the second was, she is supposed to be here! Like, she can fake it, she can become it So I was like, ""Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here! And tomorrow you're going to fake it, you're going to make yourself powerful, and, you know — (Applause) And you're going to go into the classroom, and you are going to give the best comment ever"
1085,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," (Laughter) She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it So she had changed And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it Fake it till you become it Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes So, this is two minutes"
1086,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation, for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator, in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors That's what you want to do Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation Get your testosterone up Get your cortisol down Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am"
1087,Your body language may shape who you are,Amy Cuddy,"['business', 'science']"," So I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing, and also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple I don't have ego involved in this (Laughter) Give it away Share it with people, because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power Give it to them because they can do it in private"

1101,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']","We live in an incredibly busy world The pace of life is often frantic, our minds are always busy, and we're always doing something So with that in mind, I'd like you just to take a moment to think, when did you last take any time to do nothing? Just 10 minutes, undisturbed? And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing So that's no emailing, texting, no Internet, no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading"
1102,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," Simply doing nothing I see a lot of very blank faces (Laughter) You probably have to go a long way back And this is an extraordinary thing, right? We're talking about our mind The mind, our most valuable and precious resource, through which we experience every single moment of our life"
1103,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused, creative, spontaneous, and to perform at our very best in everything that we do And yet, we don't take any time out to look after it In fact, we spend more time looking after our cars, our clothes and our hair than we — okay, maybe not our hair, (Laughter) but you see where I'm going The result, of course, is that we get stressed"
1104,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," And the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we're no longer present in the world in which we live We miss out on the things that are most important to us, and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes, that's the way life is, so we've just kind of got to get on with it That's really not how it has to be So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class"
1105,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," I'd also seen a few kung fu movies, and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly, but I was very young at the time Now as I was there, I guess, like a lot of people, I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind You get stressed, you do some meditation"
1106,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," Every time I sort of pushed one down, another one would pop back up again It was a really very stressful time I guess we all deal with stress in different ways Some people will bury themselves in work, grateful for the distraction Others will turn to their friends, their family, looking for support Some people hit the bottle, start taking medication My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk"
1107,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," People often ask me what I learned from that time Well, obviously it changed things Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things But it was more than that It taught me — it gave me a greater appreciation, an understanding for the present moment"
1108,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," I think the present moment is so underrated It sounds so ordinary, and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it's anything but ordinary There was a research paper that came out of Harvard, just recently, that said on average, our minds are lost in thought almost 47 percent of the time 47 percent At the same time, this sort of constant mind-wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness"
1109,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day, it impacts our entire life But we need to know how to do it We need an exercise We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful That's essentially what meditation is It's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it"
1110,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," It's more about stepping back, sort of seeing the thought clearly, witnessing it coming and going, emotions coming and going without judgment, but with a relaxed, focused mind So for example, right now, if I focus too much on the balls, then there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time Equally, if I relax too much talking to you, there's no way I can focus on the balls I'm going to drop them"
1111,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," It's a very uncomfortable way to live life, when you get this tight and stressed At other times, we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much, and things just become a sort of little bit like this Of course in meditation — (Snores) we're going to end up falling asleep So we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement"
1112,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," Let's say this is an anxious thought Everything's going fine, and we see the anxious thought ""Oh, I didn't realize I was worried about that"" You go back to it, repeat it ""Oh, I am worried I really am worried Wow, there's so much anxiety"" And before we know it, right, we're anxious about feeling anxious (Laughter) You know, this is crazy We do this all the time, even on an everyday level If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth"
1113,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds? (Mumbling) It does hurt And we reinforce the storyline, right? And we just keep telling ourselves, and we do it all the time And it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way, you might see many different patterns"
1114,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," Don't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that You might find a mind that's very dull and boring, and it's just, almost mechanical, it just seems it's as if you're getting up, going to work, eat, sleep, get up, work Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round your mind"
1115,All it takes is 10 mindful minutes,Andy Puddicombe,"['culture', 'health']"," We can't change every little thing that happens to us in life, but we can change the way that we experience it That's the potential of meditation, of mindfulness You don't have to burn any incense, and you definitely don't have to sit on the floor All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back, to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus, calm and clarity in your life"

1117,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," (Laughter) I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds Not everybody gets to do that These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them The worst part is putting this sweater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head All right So, why did I do that? That was awkward"
1118,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," Image is powerful, but also, image is superficial I just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair"
1119,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," So today, for me, being fearless means being honest And I am on this stage because I am a model I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman, and in my industry, we call that a sexy girl I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest twist So the first question is, how do you become a model? I always just say, ""Oh, I was scouted,"" but that means nothing"
1120,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like, ""Wait Naomi Tyra"
1121,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," Liu Wen"" And first, I commend you on your model knowledge Very impressive (Laughter) But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired, and of the 677 models that were hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white"
1122,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture'],""" But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, ""Why? You know? You can be anything You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one"" (Laughter) If, after this amazing list, they still are like, ""No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"" well, then I say, ""Be my boss"
1123,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up It's out of your control, and it's awesome, and it's not a career path I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right now"
1124,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," (Laughter) It will look something like this (Laughter) Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle That was — I don't know what happened there Unfortunately, after you've gone to school, and you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore, so if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your résumé reads, ""Underwear Model: 10 years,"" people give you a funny look"
1125,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," This picture is the very first picture that I ever took, and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini, and I didn't even have my period yet I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier Here's me on the same day as this shoot My friend got to come Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue"
1126,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," And here's me today And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me They are constructions, and they are constructions by a group of professionals, by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production, and they build this That's not me"
1127,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled over, and all it took was a ""Sorry, officer,"" and we were on our way And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are"
1128,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of, ""Will I get stopped?"" but ""How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"" When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States, 53% don't like their bodies, and that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17"
1129,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture'],""" And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that We say, ""It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people"" And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is, ""I am insecure"" And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day"
1130,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," When I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, ""Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"" and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, ""and it doesn't always make me happy"
1131,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.",Cameron Russell,['culture']," But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now"
1132,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture'],
1133,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," So I travel the globe, and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting — desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity — desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies"
1134,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult? And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship, I think, is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs On the one hand, our need for security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence"
1135,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," But we also have an equally strong need — men and women — for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise — you get the gist For journey, for travel So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship, or what we today like to call a passionate marriage, used to be a contradiction in terms"
1136,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long (Laughter) So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one"
1137,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," Give me novelty, give me familiarity Give me predictability, give me surprise And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that (Laughter) (Applause) So now we get to the existential reality of the story, right? Because I think, in some way — and I'll come back to that — but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination"
1138,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's ""to have"" And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is ""to want"" In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved We want to minimize the distance We want to contract that gap We want to neutralize the tensions We want closeness But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest"
1139,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," You know? In desire, we want a bridge to cross Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air Desire needs space And when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract But then I took a question with me And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with ""Mating in Captivity,"" and I asked people, when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner? Not attracted sexually, per Se, but most drawn"
1140,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," So the first group is: I am most drawn to my partner when she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner, when my imagination comes back in the picture, and when I can root it in absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire But then the second group is even more interesting"
1141,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," Basically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident Probably the biggest turn-on across the board Radiant, as in self-sustaining I look at this person — by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other I don't know in inches how much that is But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them"
1142,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other Because sometimes, as Proust says, mystery is not about traveling to new places, but it's about looking with new eyes"
1143,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," And then, more importantly, in this description about the other or myself — it's the same — what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire Nobody needs anybody There is no caretaking in desire Caretaking is mightily loving It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac (Laughter) I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them Wanting them is one thing"
1144,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," (Laughter) For good reasons, right? And then the third group of answers usually would be: when I'm surprised, when we laugh together, as somebody said to me in the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots But basically it's when there is novelty But novelty isn't about new positions It isn't a repertoire of techniques"
1145,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another, or others"
1146,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," It isn't just a behavior And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in, which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence You know, animals have sex It's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct We are the only ones who have an erotic life, which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination"
1147,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," We can hint at it We don't even have to do it We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire The ability to imagine it, as if it's happening, to experience it as if it's happening, while nothing is happening and everything is happening, at the same time So when I began to think about eroticism, I began to think about the poetics of sex"
1148,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," What are the ingredients? Imagination, playfulness, novelty, curiosity, mystery But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination"
1149,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," And I looked at it, looking at the community that I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors, and in my community, there were two groups: those who didn't die, and those who came back to life"
1150,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture'], Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death They knew how to keep themselves alive
1151,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," And so I began to ask a different question ""I shut myself off when "" began to be the question ""I turn off my desires when "" Which is not the same question as, ""What turns me off is "" and ""You turn me off when "
1152,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture'],""" And then I began to ask the reverse question ""I turn myself on when "" Because most of the time, people like to ask the question, ""You turn me on, what turns me on,"" and I'm out of the question, you know? Now, if you are dead inside, the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's It won't make a dent There is nobody at the reception desk (Laughter) So I turn myself on when, I turn on my desires, I wake up when "
1153,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love: jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance, naughtiness, mischief Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day You know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct"
1154,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," (Laughter) But no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love, because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word: the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another"
1155,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," Our need for connection, our need for separateness, or our need for security and adventure, or our need for togetherness and for autonomy, and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable, and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore That's the beginning of desire, that exploratory need, curiosity, discovery"
1156,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," And if you tell them, ""Hey kiddo, the world's a great place Go for it There's so much fun out there,"" then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time They can go off in their imagination, off in their body, off in their playfulness, all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back But if on this side there is somebody who says, ""I'm worried I'm anxious I'm depressed"
1157,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," What's so good out there? Don't we have everything you need together, you and I?"" then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize Some of us will come back, came back a long time ago, and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection"
1158,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," Translate this into adult language It starts very young It continues into our sex lives up to the end Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time ""Are you going to be there? Are you going to curse me, scold me? Are you going to be angry with me?"" And they may be gone, but they're never really away And those are often the people that will tell you, ""In the beginning, it was super hot"
1159,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," The more connected I became, the more responsible I felt, the less I was able to let go in your presence The third child doesn't really come back So what happens, if you want to sustain desire, it's that real dialectic piece On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go"
1160,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs, there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do One, they have a lot of sexual privacy They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm"
1161,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc, maybe where you leave the Agile program — (Laughter) And you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible Responsibility and desire just butt heads They don't really do well together Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes It's pretty much like the moon It has intermittent eclipses"
1162,The secret to desire in a long-term relationship,Esther Perel,['culture']," They know how to bring it back And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth, which is the myth of spontaneity, which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship, already has Committed sex is premeditated sex It's willful It's intentional It's focus and presence"
1163,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']","(Breathes in) (Breathes out) So, I didn't always make my living from music For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job (Laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life (Laughter) Hello"
1164,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing — as they walked away (Laughter) So I had the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks, and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street, and we would sort of fall in love a little bit And my eyes would say — ""Thank you I see you"
1165,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," Thank you"" I would get harassed sometimes People would yell at me from their cars ""Get a job!"" (Laughing) And I'd be, like, ""This is my job"" But it hurt, because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair, shameful I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box"
1166,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," It was consistent And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls This was me on piano, a genius drummer I wrote the songs, and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue, and as we started touring, I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people, because I loved it"
1167,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house This is in London People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us This is in Seattle"
1168,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," This is a library in Auckland On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat, because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast, and they showed up care of this dude, Chris, from Newport Beach, who says hello I once tweeted, ""Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?"" And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death"
1169,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless, and in punk squats, everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless, clearly making it the better option"
1170,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds And I lay there thinking, these people have so little Is this fair? And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, ""Your music has helped my daughter so much Thank you for staying here We're all so grateful"
1171,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," This is this A couple of months later, I was in Manhattan, and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight, I'm on the Lower East Side, and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone I've always been with my band or my crew Is this what stupid people do? (Laughter) Is this how stupid people die? And before I can change my mind, the door busts open She's an artist"
1172,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," So I couchsurf a lot I also crowdsurf a lot I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money, something that I did a lot"
1173,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat And I recognized his fear of ""Is this fair?"" and ""Get a job"" And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger We sign with a major label And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret It's not for everybody Well, maybe it's for you (Laughter) We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record"
1174,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," I was like, ""25,000, isn't that a lot?"" They said, ""No, the sales are going down It's a failure"" And they walk off Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig, and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill, and he says, ""I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend"" (Laughter) ""But I read your blog, I know you hate your label I just want you to have this money"" And this starts happening all the time"
1175,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," Thank you And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street So I fought my way off my label, and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding"
1176,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," And the goal was 100,000 dollars My fans backed me at nearly 12 million, which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date (Applause) And you can see how many people it is It's about 25,000 people And the media asked, ""Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy How did you make all these people pay for music?"" And the real answer is, I didn't make them I asked them"
1177,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']", It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists They don't want to ask for things But it's not easy It's not easy to ask And a lot of artists have a problem with this Asking makes you vulnerable
1178,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," And this hurt in a really familiar way And people saying, ""You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help,"" really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, ""Get a job"" Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them So this is slightly not safe for work This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin"
1179,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," Now let me tell you, if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers — (Laughter) I recommend this, especially if those strangers are drunk German people (Laughter) This was a ninja master-level fan connection, because what I was really saying here was, I trust you this much Should I? Show me For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community Connectors and openers, not untouchable stars"
1180,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done, the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell, I don't see these things as risk I see them as trust Now, the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street, they're getting there"
1181,The art of asking,Amanda Palmer,"['business', 'entertainment']"," My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other"
1182,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']","When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet And I grew up singing a song called ""Nothing To Envy"" And I was very proud In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung, but we never learned much about the outside world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies"
1183,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution But I thought my life in North Korea was normal My family was not poor, and myself, I had never experienced hunger But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister It read, ""When you read this, our five family members will not exist in this world, because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks"
1184,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']",""" I was so shocked This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering Soon after, when I was walking past a train station, I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory A lifeless woman was lying on the ground, while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face But nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families"
1185,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine, and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark Power outages also became more and more frequent, so everything around me was completely dark at night, except for the sea of lights in China, just across the river from my home I always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night, compared to neighbors"
1186,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points, allowing North Koreans to secretly cross But many die Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea, but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine, I was sent to China to live with distant relatives But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time"
1187,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed, and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate, back in North Korea"
1188,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Someone had accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese language abilities, and asked me tons of questions I was so scared I thought my heart was going to explode If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated I thought my life was over But I managed to control all the emotions inside me, and answer the questions After they finished questioning me, one official said to another, ""This was a false report"
1189,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']",""" And they let me go It was a miracle Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies But many can be caught by the Chinese police, and repatriated These girls were so lucky Even though they were caught, they were eventually released, after heavy international pressure These North Koreans were not so lucky"
1190,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Even though I was really fortunate to get out, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive Even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea And I started a new life yet again"
1191,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," English was so important in South Korea, so I had to start learning my third language Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South We are all Korean, but inside, we have become very different, due to 67 years of division I even went through an identity crisis Am I South Korean or North Korean? Where am I from? Who am I? Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own"
1192,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family, and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside They had to get out quickly So I started planning how to help them escape North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom"
1193,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," So, ironically, I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles in China, and then into Southeast Asia The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer He took everyone's ID cards, and he started asking them questions"
1194,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," As the Chinese officer approached my family, I impulsively stood up, and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning He looked at me suspiciously, but luckily, he believed me We made it all the way to the border of Laos But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos But even after we got past the border, my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing"
1195,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," But soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again, in the capital of Laos This was one of the lowest points in my life I did everything to get my family to freedom, and we came so close, but my family was thrown in jail, just a short distance from the South Korean embassy I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to get my family out"
1196,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," I lost all hope At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me, ""What's wrong?"" I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask In my broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without hesitating, the man went to the ATM, and he paid the rest of the money for my family, and two other North Koreans to get out of jail"
1197,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," ""I'm helping the North Korean people"" I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people, when we needed it most And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea"
1198,My escape from North Korea,Hyeonseo Lee,"['culture', 'global issues']"," Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money So we can benefit from the international community for education, English language training, job training, and more We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world"
1199,My journey to yo-yo mastery, BLACK,['entertainment'],"When I was 14 years old, I had low self-esteem I felt I was not talented at anything One day, I bought a yo-yo When I tried my first trick, it looked like this: (Laughter) I couldn't even do the simplest trick, but it was very natural for me, because I was not dextrous, and hated all sports But after one week of practicing, my throws became more like this: A bit better I thought, the yo-yo is something for me to be good at"
1200,My journey to yo-yo mastery, BLACK,['entertainment']," I was spending all my time practicing It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level And then, four years later, when I was 18 years old, I was standing onstage at the World YoYo Contest And I won I was so excited ""Yes, I did it! I became a hero I may get many sponsors, a lot of money, tons of interviews, and be on TV!"" I thought (Laughter) But after coming back to Japan, totally nothing changed in my life"
1201,My journey to yo-yo mastery, BLACK,['entertainment']," So I went back to my college and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body I felt I was not alive anymore So I started to consider what I should do, and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better, and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be to change the public's image of the yo-yo So I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer"
1202,My journey to yo-yo mastery, BLACK,['entertainment']," As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others, it happened I won the World YoYo Contest again in the artistic performance division I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil Today, I am standing on the TED stage with the yo-yo in front of you (Applause) What I learned from the yo-yo is, if I make enough effort with huge passion, there is no impossible"
1203,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business'],"When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests I gave out homework assignments When the work came back, I calculated grades What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students"
1204,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well And that got me thinking The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough"
1205,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist"
1206,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business'], We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition
1207,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," And it wasn't social intelligence It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ It was grit Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals Grit is having stamina Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint"
1208,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school"
1209,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it Every day, parents and teachers ask me, ""How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"" The honest answer is, I don't know (Laughter) What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty"
1210,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called ""growth mindset"" This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort Dr"
1211,Grit: The power of passion and perseverance,Angela Lee Duckworth,['business']," So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit But we need more And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are That's the work that stands before us We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned"
1212,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture'],"Thank you very much I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids Actually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles — (Laughter) thinking we were moving to America, but anyway — (Laughter) It's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America (Laughter) I got here 12 years ago, and when I got here, I was told various things, like, ""Americans don't get irony"" (Laughter) Have you come across this idea? It's not true"
1213,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony It's one of those cultural myths, like, ""The British are reserved"" (Laughter) I don't know why people think this We've invaded every country we've encountered (Laughter) But it's not true Americans don't get irony, but I just want you to know that that's what people are saying about you behind your back"
1214,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," (Laughter) But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation, ""No Child Left Behind"" (Laughter) Because whoever thought of that title gets irony (Laughter) Don't they? (Applause) Because it's leaving millions of children behind Now I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation: ""Millions of Children Left Behind"" I can see that"
1215,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," And it's working beautifully (Laughter) In some parts of the country, 60 percent of kids drop out of high school In the Native American communities, it's 80 percent of kids If we halved that number, one estimate is it would create a net gain to the US economy over 10 years, of nearly a trillion dollars"
1216,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it, who don't enjoy it, who don't get any real benefit from it And the reason is not that we're not spending enough money America spends more money on education than most other countries Class sizes are smaller than in many countries And there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education"
1217,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," There are three principles on which human life flourishes, and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure The first is this, that human beings are naturally different and diverse Can I ask you, how many of you have got children of your own? Okay Or grandchildren How about two children or more? Right And the rest of you have seen such children"
1218,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," (Laughter) I will make you a bet, and I am confident that I will win the bet If you've got two children or more, I bet you they are completely different from each other Aren't they? (Applause) You would never confuse them, would you? Like, ""Which one are you? Remind me"" (Laughter) ""Your mother and I need some color-coding system so we don't get confused"" Education under ""No Child Left Behind"" is based on not diversity but conformity"
1219,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," One of the effects of ""No Child Left Behind"" has been to narrow the focus onto the so-called STEM disciplines They're very important I'm not here to argue against science and math On the contrary, they're necessary but they're not sufficient A real education has to give equal weight to the arts, the humanities, to physical education"
1220,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," ADHD I'm not saying there's no such thing I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this If you sit kids down, hour after hour, doing low-grade clerical work, don't be surprised if they start to fidget, you know? (Laughter) (Applause) Children are not, for the most part, suffering from a psychological condition They're suffering from childhood (Laughter) And I know this because I spent my early life as a child I went through the whole thing"
1221,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," And by the way, the arts aren't just important because they improve math scores They're important because they speak to parts of children's being which are otherwise untouched The second, thank you — (Applause) The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child, they will learn without any further assistance, very often Children are natural learners"
1222,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Curiosity is the engine of achievement Now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here, if I can say so, has been to de-professionalize teachers There is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools But teaching is a creative profession Teaching, properly conceived, is not a delivery system"
1223,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Great teachers do that, but what great teachers also do is mentor, stimulate, provoke, engage You see, in the end, education is about learning If there's no learning going on, there's no education going on And people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning The whole point of education is to get people to learn An old friend of mine — actually very old, he's dead"
1224,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," (Laughter) But a wonderful guy he was, wonderful philosopher He used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs You can be engaged in the activity of something, but not really be achieving it, like dieting (Laughter) It's a very good example There he is He's dieting Is he losing any weight? Not really (Laughter) Teaching is a word like that You can say, ""There's Deborah, she's in room 34, she's teaching"
1225,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning That's it And part of the problem is, I think, that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning, but testing Now, testing is important Standardized tests have a place But they should not be the dominant culture of education They should be diagnostic They should help (Applause) If I go for a medical examination, I want some standardized tests I do"
1226,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car (Laughter) ""Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange"" ""Really?"" (Laughter) ""Is that good?"" ""We don't know"" (Laughter) But all that should support learning It shouldn't obstruct it, which of course it often does So in place of curiosity, what we have is a culture of compliance"
1227,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," And the third principle is this: that human life is inherently creative It's why we all have different résumés We create our lives, and we can recreate them as we go through them It's the common currency of being a human being It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic I mean, other animals may well have imaginations and creativity, but it's not so much in evidence, is it, as ours? I mean, you may have a dog"
1228,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," You know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it? (Laughter) And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels (Laughter) ""Would you like to come for a walk?"" ""No, I'm fine"" (Laughter) ""You go I'll wait But take pictures"" (Laughter) We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities, and one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity"
1229,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Now, it doesn't have to be that way It really doesn't Finland regularly comes out on top in math, science and reading Now, we only know that's what they do well at, because that's all that's being tested That's one of the problems of the test They don't look for other things that matter just as much The thing about work in Finland is this: they don't obsess about those disciplines"
1230,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Second, there is no standardized testing in Finland I mean, there's a bit, but it's not what gets people up in the morning, what keeps them at their desks"
1231,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Why would you drop out? If people are in trouble, we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them"" Now people always say, ""Well, you know, you can't compare Finland to America"" No I think there's a population of around five million in Finland But you can compare it to a state in America Many states in America have fewer people in them than that I mean, I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there"
1232,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Really I was asked to lock up when I left (Laughter) But what all the high-performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident, sadly, across the systems in America — I mean, as a whole One is this: they individualize teaching and learning They recognize that it's students who are learning and the system has to engage them, their curiosity, their individuality, and their creativity That's how you get them to learn"
1233,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," They recognize that you can't improve education if you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development Investing in professional development is not a cost It's an investment, and every other country that's succeeding well knows that, whether it's Australia, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong or Shanghai They know that to be the case"
1234,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," You see, there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education — That's what happens in some systems Central or state governments decide, they know best and they're going to tell you what to do The trouble is that education doesn't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings"
1235,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," You have to put it back to the people (Applause) There is wonderful work happening in this country But I have to say it's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education, not because of it It's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time And the reason I think is this: that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education"
1236,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," It won't, and it never did The point is that education is not a mechanical system It's a human system It's about people, people who either do want to learn or don't want to learn Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography They may find it boring They may find it irrelevant They may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school"
1237,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of — they're called alternative education programs These are programs designed to get kids back into education They have certain common features They're very personalized They have strong support for the teachers, close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum, and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school And they work"
1238,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture'],""" (Laughter) You know? And all the evidence from around the world is, if we all did that, there'd be no need for the alternative (Applause) (Applause ends) So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor We have to recognize that it's a human system, and there are conditions under which people thrive, and conditions under which they don't We are after all organic creatures, and the culture of the school is absolutely essential"
1239,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," Death Valley is the hottest, driest place in America, and nothing grows there Nothing grows there because it doesn't rain Hence, Death Valley In the winter of 2004, it rained in Death Valley Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period And in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while What it proved is this: that Death Valley isn't dead It's dormant"
1240,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," It happens all the time You take an area, a school, a district, you change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility, a different set of expectations, a broader range of opportunities, you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners, you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do, and schools that were once bereft spring to life Great leaders know that"
1241,How to escape education's death valley,Sir Ken Robinson,['culture']," The real role of leadership is climate control, creating a climate of possibility And if you do that, people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn't have expected There's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin"
1242,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture'],"When I was in my 20s, I saw my very first psychotherapy client I was a PhD student in clinical psychology at Berkeley She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top, and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems Now when I heard this, I was so relieved My classmate got an arsonist for her first client"
1243,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," This I thought I could handle But I didn't handle it With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session, it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road ""Thirty's the new 20,"" Alex would say, and as far as I could tell, she was right Work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later, even death happened later Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time"
1244,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," I pushed back I said, ""Sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy"" And then my supervisor said, ""Not yet, but she might marry the next one Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one"" That's what psychologists call an ""Aha!"" moment That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20"
1245,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot, and we were sitting there, blowing it That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now"
1246,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," (Laughter) Raise your hand if you're in your 20s I really want to see some twentysomethings here Oh, yay! You are all awesome If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething, you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see — Okay Awesome, twentysomethings really matter"
1247,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," This is not my opinion These are the facts We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35 That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and ""Aha!"" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s People who are over 40, don't panic This crowd is going to be fine, I think"
1248,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it"
1249,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become"
1250,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like ""twixters"" and ""kidults"" (Laughing) It's true! As a culture, we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time"
1251,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition, and absolutely nothing happens And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: ""I know my boyfriend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't count I'm just killing time"" Or they say, ""Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine"
1252,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college"" And then it starts to sound like this: ""Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs Everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30"
1253,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," (Laughter) Okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s"
1254,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," It's realizing you can't have that career you now want It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20s, ""What was I doing? What was I thinking?"" I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking Here's a story about how that can go"
1255,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition And as hard as her 20s were, her early life had been even harder"
1256,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture'],""" Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour She'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words ""In case of emergency, please call "
1257,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture'],""" But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear"
1258,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," By ""get identity capital,"" I mean do something that adds value to who you are Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital So now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try"
1259,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," That's procrastination I told Emma to explore work and make it count Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport, but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle"
1260,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed But half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group Half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job It's not cheating It's the science of how information spreads Last but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends"
1261,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work"
1262,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture']," So what happened to Emma? Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state That weak tie helped her get a job there That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums She's married to a man she mindfully chose"
1263,Why 30 is not the new 20,Meg Jay,['culture'],""" Now Emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings They are so easy to help Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX, bound for somewhere west Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji"
1264,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology'],"So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic? We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters, or quads, for short Quads have been around for a long time They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple"
1265,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," On board are also a battery, a computer, various sensors and wireless radios Quads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost They are inherently unstable, and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly So, how did it just do that? Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them"
1266,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology'], The bulk of our research is algorithms It's the magic that brings these machines to life So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete? We use something broadly called model-based design We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them
1267,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology'], We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole
1268,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top, which means that it can be located in the space (Audience) Oh! (Applause) (Applause ends) You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced How did we design the algorithms to do this? We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad"
1269,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Here, you see that it's stable, and even if I give it little nudges, it goes back — to the nice, balanced position We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space Using this pointer, made out of reflective markers, I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me"
1270,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop, and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it Unlike the balancing pole, I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system In fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass is there"
1271,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," (Applause) (Applause ends) Okay, you should be asking yourself, why doesn't the water fall out of the glass? Two facts The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up"
1272,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," And that's why you don't need to model the glass It naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does (Audience) Oh! (Applause) (Applause ends) The lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others, and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard In this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy Balancing a pole is hard"
1273,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage? Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly, because there are four degrees of freedom to control: roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration Hexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers, can provide redundancy, but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four"
1274,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," We relinquish control of yaw, but roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible In this instance, this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage, just like human athletes do, instead of building machines with redundancy"
1275,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology'], Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry? Will the vaulter stick the landing? Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution There simply isn't enough time
1276,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Similar to the diver and the vaulter, it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard (Laughter) (Applause) Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports"
1277,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds, or 50 times per second We first figure out where the ball is going We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from Third, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy"
1278,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," (Applause) Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own, they can do it collectively These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net (Applause) (Applause ends) They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me Notice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical"
1279,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology'], The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being? What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming
1280,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Similar to the pointer that I used earlier, we can use this as inputs to the system We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures (Applause) Interaction doesn't have to be virtual It can be physical Take this quad, for example It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me, and moves back to where it wants to be"
1281,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics, as far as the quad is concerned, of course Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine"
1282,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics Let's have a little bit of fun with this For what you will see next, these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto As time goes on, gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth, but I assure you we won't get there Okay, here goes"
1283,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Others think that it has more of a social role, that it's used to bind the group Similarly, we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life? Like all our past creations and innovations, they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused"
1284,The astounding athletic power of quadcopters,Raffaello D'Andrea,['technology']," Let's make the right choice, the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines, just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team (Applause) Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini, Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin, Mark Muller and Robin Ritz Look out for them They're destined for great things"
1285,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment'],"My name is Tom, and I've come here today to come clean about what I do for money Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash (Laughter) I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners, so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting, but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what I do (Beatboxing) And now, for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics"
1286,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment']," (Beatboxing: ""Billie Jean"") ♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫ ♫ She's just a girl who claims that I am the one ♫ ♫ But the kid is not my son ♫ (Applause) All right Wassup Thank you very much, TEDx If you guys haven't figured it out already, my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer, which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice, and the only thing was my voice"
1287,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment']," And I'm very, very stoked — (Applause) You guys are just applauding for everything It's great Look at this, Mom! I made it! I'm very, very stoked to be here today, representing my kinfolk and all those that haven't managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking Because it is a bit of a niche market, and there's not much work going on, especially where I'm from"
1288,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment']," Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here That's good (Laughter) You know, I'm from Brizzy, which is a great city to live in, but let's be honest — it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane and outside Australia, and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world So I'd like to share with you, if I may, my experiences"
1289,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment']," We start our journey in the central deserts (Didgeridoo) (Airplane) India (Beatboxing) (Sitar) China (Guzheng) (Beatboxing) Germany (Beatboxing) Party, party, yeah (Laughter) And before we reach our final destination, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to share with you some technology that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane"
1290,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment']," For example, the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound, which gives me that — (Trumpet) — flavor (Laughter) And the other ones here, I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here (Noises) TEDx (Music) (Applause) I got way too much time on my hands"
1291,The orchestra in my mouth,Tom Thum,['entertainment']," So with all that in mind, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of Earth as I transform the Sydney Opera House into a smoky downtown jazz bar All right boys, take it away (Music) Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine, one of the greatest double bassists I know Mr Smokey Jefferson, let's take it for a walk Come on, baby"
1292,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']","What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects, and that is the neuroscience of sleep Now, there is a sound — (Alarm clock) Ah, it worked! A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us, and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock And what that truly ghastly, awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have, and that's sleep"
1293,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important And yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought We throw it away We really just don't think about sleep And so what I'd like to do today is change your views, change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep And the journey that I want to take you on, we need to start by going back in time ""Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber"
1294,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Yes, let me give you a few more quotes ""O sleep, O gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee?"" Shakespeare again, from — I won't say it — the Scottish play (Laughter) From the same time: ""Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together"" Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist But if we jump forward 400 years, the tone about sleep changes somewhat"
1295,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']",""" Bang! (Laughter) And if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said, ""Sleep is for wimps"" And of course the infamous — what was his name? — the infamous Gordon Gekko from ""Wall Street"" said, ""Money never sleeps"
1296,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," We've treated it as an enemy At most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep, and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound Why is it? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts? Well, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems You don't eat You don't drink And you don't have sex Well, most of us anyway"
1297,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," It's a complete waste of time, right? Wrong Actually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology, and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important So let's move to the brain Now, here we have a brain This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so — (Laughter) Sorry So I borrowed it I don't think they noticed OK"
1298,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," In fact, some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain, but is to some extent a network property"
1299,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up, when it's good to be asleep, and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei All of those combine, and they send projections down to the brain stem here"
1300,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain, and essentially, sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here OK So where have we got to? We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about So why do we sleep? And it won't surprise any of you that, of course, as scientists, we don't have a consensus"
1301,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," The first is sort of the restoration idea, and it's somewhat intuitive Essentially, all the stuff we've burned up during the day, we restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night And indeed, as an explanation, it goes back to Aristotle, so that's what — 2,300 years ago It's gone in and out of fashion"
1302,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis What about energy conservation? Again, perhaps intuitive You essentially sleep to save calories Now, when you do the sums, though, it doesn't really pan out If you compare an individual who has slept at night, or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much, the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night Now, that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun"
1303,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea But the third idea I'm quite attracted to, which is brain processing and memory consolidation What we know is that, if after you've tried to learn a task, and you sleep-deprive individuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed It's really hugely attenuated So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important However, it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it"
1304,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," In fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage Sleeping at night enhances our creativity And what seems to be going on is that, in the brain, those neural connections that are important, those synaptic connections that are important, are linked and strengthened, while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important OK"
1305,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," But sleep is not an indulgence It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class, you know, the equivalent of It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep, you don't fly Essentially, you never get there"
1306,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," So let's now look at sleep deprivation Huge sectors of society are sleep-deprived, and let's look at our sleep-o-meter So in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night Nowadays, we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night, so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours every-night league For teenagers, it's worse, much worse"
1307,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," It's simply not enough If we think about other sectors of society — the aged; if you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again, less than five hours a night Shift work Shift work is extraordinary, perhaps 20 percent of the working population, and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night It's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us"
1308,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," This is the time to be awake"" So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region And then, of course, tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag So who here has jet lag? Well, my goodness gracious Well, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep, because that's what your brain is craving"
1309,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Now, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing, but they can also be deadly It's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life, and in the US, the statistics are pretty good: 100,000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness, loss of vigilance, and falling asleep — a hundred thousand a year It's extraordinary"
1310,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," And in the investigations that followed those disasters, poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters When you're tired and you lack sleep, you have poor memory, you have poor creativity, you have increased impulsiveness, and you have overall poor judgment But my friends, it's so much worse than that"
1311,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," So drugs, stimulants Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world Much of the day is fueled by caffeine, and if you're a really naughty tired brain, nicotine Of course, you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants, and then, of course, it gets to 11 o'clock at night, and the brain says to itself, ""Actually, I need to be asleep fairly shortly"
1312,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Now alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful It can actually ease the sleep transition But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall"
1313,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain If you sleep around about five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese What's the connection here? Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone Ghrelin is released It gets to the brain The brain says, ""I need carbohydrates,"" and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars"
1314,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Tired people are massively stressed And one of the things of stress, of course, is loss of memory, which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of But stress is so much more So, if you're acutely stressed, not a great problem, but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity"
1315,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant Therefore, diabetes 2 Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain, which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides"
1316,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here? Oh Well, that's pretty impressive Good We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips So most of us, of course, ask the question, ""How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep?"" Well, it's not rocket science"
1317,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Listen to them Listen to yourself What do you do? Well — and this is slightly offensive — sleep for dummies (Laughter) Make your bedroom a haven for sleep The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can, and also make it slightly cool Very important Actually, reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep"
1318,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep Turn off those mobile phones Turn off those computers Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day, ideally not after lunch Now, we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed, but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle"
1319,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Basically, listen to yourself Wind down Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey-heavy dew of slumber OK That's some facts What about some myths? Teenagers are lazy No Poor things They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late, so give them a break We need eight hours of sleep a night That's an average Some people need more Some people need less"
1320,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," Do you need that much or do you need more? Simple as that Old people need less sleep Not true The sleep demands of the aged do not go down Essentially, sleep fragments and becomes less robust, but sleep requirements do not go down And the fourth myth is early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise Well, that's wrong at so many different levels"
1321,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," There's no difference in socioeconomic status In my experience, the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug (Laughter) (Applause) OK So for the last few minutes, what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience, which is the association between mental health, mental illness and sleep disruption"
1322,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," In the 1970s, when people started to think about this again, they said, ""Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia, because they're on antipsychotics It's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems,"" ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously, sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics"
1323,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia, and the data were quite extraordinary In those individuals with schizophrenia, much of the time, they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day Other groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever — their sleep was absolutely smashed And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle"
1324,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," It was smashed So what's going on? And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated, but they are physically linked within the brain The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep, give you normal sleep, and those that give you normal mental health, are overlapping"
1325,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," And last year, we published a study which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia, when mutated, also smashes the sleep So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems Other work flowed from these studies"
1326,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate, make worse, the mental illness state My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by 50 percent So what have we got? We've got, in these connections, some really exciting things"
1327,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal, then we have the chance of going in If we know these individuals are vulnerable, early intervention then becomes possible And the third, which I think is the most exciting, is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target"
1328,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," So let me just finish What I started by saying is: Take sleep seriously Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre-industrial age, when we were almost wrapped in a duvet We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep And this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense This is a pragmatic response to good health"
1329,Why do we sleep?,Russell Foster,"['health', 'science']"," If you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress, your levels of anger, your impulsivity, and your tendency to drink and take drugs And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness, and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said, ""Sleep is God"
1330,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health'],"I have a confession to make But first, I want you to make a little confession to me In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress Anyone? How about a moderate amount of stress? Who has experienced a lot of stress? Yeah Me too But that is not my confession My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier"
1331,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," For years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress"
1332,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health'], (Laughter) Okay Some bad news first People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health (Laughter) People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die
1333,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you (Laughter) That is over 20,000 deaths a year Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide"
1334,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health So this study got me wondering: Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier? And here the science says yes When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out It's called the social stress test"
1335,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," (Laughter) And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback, like this (Exhales) (Laughter) Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it Now we're going to all do this together It's going to be fun For me Okay (Laughter) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven"
1336,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Go! (Audience counting) Go faster Faster please You're going too slow (Audience counting) Stop Stop, stop, stop That guy made a mistake We are going to have to start all over again (Laughter) You're not very good at this, are you? Okay, so you get the idea If you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat"
1337,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge? Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful That pounding heart is preparing you for action If you're breathing faster, it's no problem It's getting more oxygen to your brain"
1338,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict like this And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this"
1339,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters So my goal as a health psychologist has changed I no longer want to get rid of your stress"
1340,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," And we just did a little intervention If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life, because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me rise to this challenge And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier"
1341,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response, and the idea is this: Stress makes you social To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in"
1342,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health'], It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family It enhances your empathy It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin
1343,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel, instead of bottling it up"
1344,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress It's a natural anti-inflammatory It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress"
1345,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage This stress hormone strengthens your heart And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support"
1346,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," I find this amazing, that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection I want to finish by telling you about one more study And listen up, because this study could also save a life"
1347,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," Okay, so the bad news first: For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent But — and I hope you are expecting a ""but"" by now — but that wasn't true for everyone People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying Zero Caring created resilience"
1348,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage And when you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress Stress gives us access to our hearts"
1349,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone Thank you (Applause) Chris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us"
1350,How to make stress your friend,Kelly McGonigal,['health']," How would that extend to advice, like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go? It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense? KM: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort"
1351,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment'],"Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention? Even more than that, what about predicting human behavior? I think those are interesting ideas For me, that would be the perfect superpower, actually kind of an evil way of approaching it But for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way: picking pockets"
1352,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," For example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now? Great Double-check Make sure you still have them I was doing some shopping before (Laughter) You've looked at them a few times today, but I'll ask you a question Without looking at it directly yet, can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner? Bring them out, check and see how accurate you were How'd you do? Show of hands"
1353,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," Every phone has something in common No matter how you organize the icons, you still have a clock on the front So, without looking at your phone, what time was it? You just looked at your clock, right? Interesting idea Let's take that a step further with a game of trust Close your eyes I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard there's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes Now, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds"
1354,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," What color is my shirt? What color is my tie? Now open your eyes Show of hands, were you right? Interesting, isn't it? Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems But I have a different theory about that model of attention They have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention For me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system"
1355,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," For me, I like to call him Frank So Frank is sitting at a desk He's got lots of cool information in front of him, high-tech equipment, he's got cameras, he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears, all these senses, all these perceptions But attention is what steers your perceptions, it's what controls your reality It's the gateway to the mind If you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it"
1356,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," For example, the cocktail effect: You're in a party, having conversations with someone, and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that Now, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this, to play with your attention as a limited resource So if I could control how you spend your attention, if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction"
1357,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," So if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that? What just happened? Do you have a wallet? Do you have an American Express in your wallet? And when I do that, your Frank turns around He accesses the file He has to rewind the tape What's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape at the same time that he's trying to process new data"
1358,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," If I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping Just hold still where you are Hello, how are you? It's lovely to see you Wonderful job onstage Lovely watch, it doesn't come off very well Do you have a ring as well? Good Just taking inventory You're like a buffet Hard to tell where to start, so many great things Hi, how are you? Good to see you Hi, sir, could you stand up, please? Just right where you are"
1359,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," Nice to meet you, sir You don't have a lot in your pockets Anything down here? Hopefully so Have a seat There you go You're doing well Hi, sir, how are you? Good to see you, sir You have a ring, a watch Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't AR: Well, we'll find one for you Come on up this way, Joe Give Joe a round of applause Come on up, Joe Let's play a game (Applause) AR: Pardon me I don't think I need this clicker anymore"
1360,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," I appreciate that Come on up to the stage, Joe Let's play a little game now Anything in your front pockets? J: Money AR: Money! All right, let's try that Can you stand right over this way for me? Turn around and, let's see, if I give you something that belongs to me, this is just something I have, a poker chip Hold out your hand for me Watch it closely This is a task for you to focus on You have your money in your front pocket? J: Yup AR: Good"
1361,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," I'm not ready for that kind of commitment Once a guy had a hole in his pocket, and that was rather traumatizing for me I wanted his wallet, he gave me his number Big miscommunication (Laughter) Let's do this simply Squeeze your hand tight Do you feel the poker chip in your hand? J: I do AR: Would you be surprised if I took it? Say yes J: Very AR: Good Open your hand Thank you very much I'll cheat if you give me a chance Make it harder for me"
1362,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm Did you see it go? Joe: No AR: No, it's not here Open your hand While we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder Go ahead and take it off Now, let's try that again Hold your hand out flat Open it up Put your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close If I did it slowly, it'd be on your shoulder (Laughter) Joe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it You'll get it eventually"
1363,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," Squeeze firm You're human, you're not slow It's back on your shoulder You were focused on your hand, distracted While you were watching, I couldn't get your watch off Yet you had something inside your pocket Do you remember what it was? J: Money AR: Check your pocket Is it still there? (Laughter) Oh, there it was Put it away We're just shopping This trick's more about the timing I'm going to try to push it inside your hand"
1364,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," AR: Oh, thanks (Applause) But it's only a start Let's try it a little bit differently Hold your hands together Your other hand on top If you're watching this little token, this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away It's not back on your shoulder It falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand Did you see it go? Yeah, funny We've got a little guy"
1365,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket Is it in this pocket, sir? Don't reach in your pocket That's a different show (Squeaking) That's rather strange They have shots for that Can I show them? Rather bizarre Is this yours, sir? I have no idea how that works We'll send that over there I need help with this one Step over this way for me Don't run away You had something down by your pants pocket I was checking mine"
1366,The art of misdirection,Apollo Robbins,['entertainment']," Can I feel the outside for a moment? Down here I noticed this Is this something of yours, sir? I have no idea That's a shrimp J: Yeah I'm saving it for later AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way, better than you know So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift (Laughter) Hopefully it matches his taste We have a couple of other things, a little bit of cash"
1367,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']","So my name is Amy Webb, and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion And I thought, what's wrong with me? I don't understand why this keeps happening So I asked everybody in my life what they thought I turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice, and she said, ""Stop being so picky You've got to date around"
1368,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']",""" Now as it turns out, I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data, as you'll soon find I am constantly swimming in numbers, formulas and charts I also have a very tight-knit family, and I'm very, very close with my sister, and as a result, I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up"
1369,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," And if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35, that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago So that wasn't going to work If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love, then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity In short, I was trying to figure out what's the probability of my finding Mr"
1370,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," So again, I started doing some math Population of Philadelphia: it has 15 million people I figure about half of that are men, so that takes the number down to 750,000 I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36, which was only four percent of the population, so now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men I was looking for somebody who was Jewish, because I am and that was important to me That's only 23 percent of the population"
1371,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," So that basically meant there were 35 men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia In the meantime, my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children, and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already So I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out"
1372,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']","5-million-person city of Philadelphia, or I could try online dating Now, I like the idea of online dating, because it's predicated on an algorithm, and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem, I'm going to use some data, run it through a system and get to a solution"
1373,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']",
1374,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," So in my case, I thought, well, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming? So I decided to sign on Now, there was one small catch As I'm signing on to the various dating websites, as it happens, I was really, really busy But that actually wasn't the biggest problem The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind, and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes"
1375,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," (Laughter) So in the descriptive part up top, I said that I was an award-winning journalist and a future thinker When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date, I said monetization and fluency in Japanese I talked a lot about JavaScript (Laughter) So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date"
1376,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," There was this guy Steve, the IT guy The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets, we share a love of math and data and '80s music, and so I agreed to go out with him So Steve the IT guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth, extremely expensive restaurants And we went in, and right off the bat, our conversation really wasn't taking flight, but he was ordering a lot of food"
1377,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well, and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table, also lots and lots of bottles of wine So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner, and I've decided Steve the IT guy and I are really just not meant for each other, but we'll part ways as friends, when he gets up to go to the bathroom, and in the meantime, the bill comes to our table"
1378,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," I am totally down with splitting the bill But then Steve the IT guy didn't come back (Gasping) And that was my entire month's rent (Audience gasps) So needless to say, I was not having a good night So I run home, I call my mother, I call my sister, and as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates, I regale them with the details And they say to me, ""Stop complaining"" (Laughter) ""You're just being too picky"
1379,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," I'm going to shove it into my bag, I'm going to have this email template, and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically, these dates really are terrible (Laughter) So I started tracking things like really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks; bad vocabulary; the number of times a man forced me to high-five him"
1380,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," So as it turns out, for some reason, men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately (Laughter) Well, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys There were just bad for me And as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up, they weren't bad either"
1381,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," See, the real problem here is that, while the algorithms work just fine, you and I don't, when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like, are you a dog person or a cat person? Do you like horror films or romance films? I'm not looking for a pen pal"
1382,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," Right? So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data So I said fine, I've got a new plan I'm going to keep using these online dating sites, but I'm going to treat them as databases, and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up, I think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system"
1383,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate? So I started writing and writing and writing, and at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points I wanted somebody was Jew-ish, so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture, but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday"
1384,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," For me, the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children, but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do, so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three, and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it"
1385,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," I also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times, regardless of what I weighed (Laughter) So I now have these 72 different data points, which, to be fair, is a lot So what I did was, I went through and I prioritized that list"
1386,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers (Laughter) So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system, because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message"
1387,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," Well, as it turns out, this worked pretty well So I go back online now I found Jewishdoc57 who's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken, he had hiked Mt Fuji, he had walked along the Great Wall He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship And I thought, I've done it! I've cracked the code I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams There was only one problem: He didn't like me back"
1388,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," Who are all of the other women on these dating sites? I found SmileyGirl1978 She said she was a ""Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing"" She listed her job as ""teacher"" She said she is ""silly, nice and friendly"" She likes to make people laugh ""alot"" At this moment I knew, clicking profile after profile that looked like this, that I needed to do some market research So I created 10 fake male profiles"
1389,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody I really was just scraping their data But I didn't want everybody's data I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry When I released these men into the wild, I did follow some rules So I didn't reach out to any woman first"
1390,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," So I was looking at qualitative data, so what was the humor, the tone, the voice, the communication style that these women shared in common? And also quantitative data, so what was the average length of their profile, how much time was spent between messages? What I was trying to get at here was that I figured, in person, I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978 I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online"
1391,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," And as it turns out, content matters a lot So smart people tend to write a lot — 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words about themselves, which may all be very, very interesting The challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very, very well, even though it may not seem like it all the time The other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non-specific language"
1392,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," Also, optimistic language matters a lot So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women, words like ""fun"" and ""girl"" and ""love"" And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile Remember, I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that"
1393,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," And as it turns out, timing is also really, really important Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake, doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people The popular women on these online sites spend an average of 23 hours in between each communication"
1394,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," And finally — there were the photos All of the women who were popular showed some skin They all looked really great, which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded (Laughter) Once I had all of this information, I was able to create a super profile, so it was still me, but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem And as it turns out, I did a really good job I was the most popular person online"
1395,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," So I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother I'm telling them about this fabulous news, and they say, ""This is wonderful! How soon are you going out?"" I said, ""Actually, I'm not going to go out with anybody"" Because remember, in my scoring system, they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points, and none of them have done that They said, ""What? You're still being too damn picky"
1396,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," He talked in detail about travel He made a lot of really interesting cultural references He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted, and immediately, he scored 850 points It was enough for a date"
1397,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," Well, a year and a half after that, we were non-cruise ship traveling through Petra, Jordan, when he got down on his knee and proposed A year after that, we were married, and about a year and a half after that, our daughter, Petra, was born Audience: Oh! (Applause) [What it means] Obviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so — (Laughter) The question is, what does all of this mean for you? Well, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love"
1398,How I hacked online dating,Amy Webb,"['culture', 'technology']"," In fact, it's something that you write yourself So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business, all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules, and feel free to be as picky as you want Well, on my wedding day, I had a conversation again with my grandmother, and she said, ""All right, maybe I was wrong"
1399,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'],
1400,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language, Goya in an image Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states As for me, I had always thought myself tough, one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp In 1991, I had a series of losses My mother died, a relationship I'd been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact"
1401,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn't know why The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment Everything there was to do seemed like too much work"
1402,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'],""" Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it"
1403,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less It was a kind of nullity And then the anxiety set in If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, ""As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it"" But if you said to me, ""You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,"" I would rather slit my wrist than go through it"
1404,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people"
1405,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang, and somehow I managed to pick it up, and it was my father, and I said, ""I'm in serious trouble We need to do something"" The next day I started with the medications and the therapy"
1406,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for And the other was that I had access to good treatment But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever"
1407,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," And then I understood that actually, we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling They're not very effective"
1408,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," They come with innumerable side effects They're a disaster But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago, when there would have been almost nothing to be done I hope that 50 years hence, people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science Depression is the flaw in love"
1409,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss, and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness Grief is explicitly reactive"
1410,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances The trajectory tells us a great deal People think of depression as being just sadness It's much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause"
1411,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'], And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive? And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression
1412,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," It's the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years, and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college, and then plummeted into a horrific depression She had bipolar illness, or manic depression, as it was then known"
1413,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later — she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins — when I interviewed her, she said, ""I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,' over and over, to occupy my mind I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying, which were, 'You are nothing You are nobody You don't even deserve to live' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself"
1414,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth But the truth lies I became obsessed with that sentence: ""But the truth lies"
1415,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," People will say, ""No one loves me"" And you say, ""I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you"" You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people But people who are depressed will also say, ""No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end"" Or they'll say, ""There can be no true communion between two human beings Each of us is trapped in his own body"
1416,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'],""" (Laughter) A lot of the time, what they are expressing is not illness, but insight, and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much"
1417,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent, and the non-depressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters — (Laughter) as they had actually killed A lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression, that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet, to have people know They said, ""Do people talk to you differently?"" I said, ""Yes, people talk to me differently"
1418,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has I went a few years ago to a conference, and on Friday of the three-day conference, one of the participants took me aside, and she said, ""I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it, but I've been taking this medication, and I just wanted to ask you what you think?"" And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could"
1419,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense, so, you know, it's just between us"" And I said, ""Yes, that's fine"
1420,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," (Laughter) And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems (Laughter) But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy Depression is so exhausting It takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better I'd started off as a medical conservative"
1421,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," But then I discovered something If you have brain cancer, and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer, and you'll still probably die from it"
1422,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments And I get letters, I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation"
1423,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," (Laughter) She sent me some of them (Laughter) And I'm not wearing them right now (Laughter) I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM And yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments, I also gained perspective on other treatments"
1424,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'],""" And he said, ""But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers, especially the ones who came right after the genocide"" I said, ""What kind of trouble did you have?"" And he said, ""Well, they would do this bizarre thing They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going They didn't involve the whole community"
1425,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them"" (Laughter) (Applause) He said, ""We had to ask them to leave the country"" (Laughter) Now at the other end of alternative treatments, let me tell you about Frank Russakoff Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man He was constantly depressed"
1426,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week Then he would feel okay for a week Then he would have a week of going downhill And then he would have another electroshock treatment And he said to me when I met him, ""It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way I can't go on this way, and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better"
1427,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'],""" And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism to reach out for one more And he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful He's now a friend of mine He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children"
1428,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," And the other present was a photo of my grandmother, who committed suicide As I unwrapped it, I began to cry, and my mother came over and said, 'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?' And I said, 'She had the same disease I have' I'm crying now as I write to you"
1429,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," I'm alive and grateful We live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it"" I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing, and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts, and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression"
1430,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability, which is presumably evenly distributed in the population, and triggering circumstances, which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time, you think, ""Why do I feel like this? I must have depression"" And you set out to find treatment for it"
1431,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'],""" And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed, and it's a tragedy of a grand order And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of DC"
1432,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," One of them, Lolly, came in, and this is what she said the day she came in She said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children She said, ""I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house I have nothing to say to my children In the morning, I can't wait for them to leave, and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head, and three o'clock when they come home, it just comes so fast"
1433,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," My husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly I wish I could stop the pain"" Well, she was brought into this experimental protocol, and when I interviewed her six months later, she had taken a job working in childcare for the US Navy, she had left the abusive husband, and she said to me, ""My kids are so much happier now"
1434,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," One of them wants to be a preacher, one of them wants to be a firefighter, and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer They don't cry like they used to, and they don't fight like they did That's all I need now, is my kids Things keep on changing, the way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act I can go outside not being afraid anymore, and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back, and if it weren't for Dr"
1435,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," I asked the Lord to send me an angel, and He heard my prayers"" I was really moved by these experiences, and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on, but also in an article, and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent And I turned in my story, and my editor called me and said, ""We really can't publish this"
1436,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley? It's just too implausible"" She said, ""I've never even heard of anything like it"" And I said, ""The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news"" (Laughter) (Applause) ""And you are a news magazine"" So after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it"
1437,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us, that treatment of depression, the medications and so on, are an artifice, and that it's not natural And I think that's very misguided It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out, but there is nobody militating against toothpaste, at least not in my circles"
1438,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken It's maladaptive People will come to me and say, ""I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year, I think I can just get through this"" And I always say to them, ""You may get through it, but you'll never be 37 again"
1439,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Think it through"" It's a strange poverty of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use this same word, depression, to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide People say to me, ""Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?"" And I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness"
1440,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that's the one we're setting out to address So now people say, ""You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"" And I don't But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity"
1441,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture'], Those are the things that I feel sad about now
1442,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," Shutting out the depression strengthens it While you hide from it, it grows And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience So Frank Russakoff said to me, ""If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way, but in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced"
1443,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," It taught me so much about love, and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me, and will be always"" And Maggie Robbins said, ""I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic, and I would just talk and talk and talk, and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought, 'That's not very friendly or helpful of them"
1444,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying, but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were Our needs are our greatest assets It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need"" Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse, but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate"
1445,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," It's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again, ""This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it"" I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts, and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way"
1446,"Depression, the secret we share",Andrew Solomon,['culture']," I felt that funeral in my brain, and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world, and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I've found a way to love my depression"
1447,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment'],"Hello, TEDWomen, what's up (Cheering) Not good enough Hello, TEDWomen, what is up? (Loud cheering) My name is Maysoon Zayid, and I am not drunk, but the doctor who delivered me was He cut my mom six different times in six different directions, suffocating poor little me in the process As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which means I shake all the time Look It's exhausting I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali (Laughter) CP is not genetic"
1448,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," You can't catch it No one put a curse on my mother's uterus, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins, which they are (Laughter) It only happens from accidents, like what happened to me on my birth day Now, I must warn you, I'm not inspirational (Laughter) And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dreamt of being disabled Come on a journey with me"
1449,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) And you're like, ""God, can't I just be a little disabled?"" (Laughter) Also, I've got to tell you, I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one (Laughter) If there was an Oppression Olympics, I would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled, and I live in New Jersey (Laughter) (Applause) If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should (Laughter) Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown"
1450,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could A lot of people with CP don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in ""can't"" My father's mantra was, ""You can do it, yes you can can"" (Laughter) So, if my three older sisters were mopping, I was mopping"
1451,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it (Laughter) My inner stripper was very strong (Laughter) Yeah No, by the first day of kindergarten, I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times"
1452,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Now there are 20 Arabs in town, and they are still all my family (Laughter) I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian (Laughter) (Applause) This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use ""I hate Muslims"" as a campaign slogan The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith They did, however, seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan"
1453,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) I have tap-danced on Broadway Yeah, on Broadway It's crazy (Applause) My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dancing school I learned how to dance in heels, which means I can walk in heels And I'm from Jersey, and we are really concerned with being chic, so if my friends wore heels, so did I And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, I did not"
1454,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, ""It's working! It's working!"" (Laughter) But one miracle cure we did find was yoga I have to tell you, it's very boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up And now I can stand on my head"
1455,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment'],""" (Laughter) I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU, Arizona State University, because I fit every single quota (Laughter) I was like the pet lemur of the theater department Everybody loved me I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework, I got A's in all of my classes, A's in all of their classes (Laughter) Every time I did a scene from ""The Glass Menagerie,"" my professors would weep"
1456,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," Finally, my senior year, ASU decided to do a show called ""They Dance Real Slow in Jackson"" It's a play about a girl with CP I was a girl with CP So I start shouting from the rooftops, ""I'm finally going to get a part! I have cerebral palsy! Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"" I didn't get the part (Laughter) Sherry Brown got the part"
1457,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," I said, ""Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts, neither can the character"" (Laughter) (Applause) This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress College was imitating life Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen Upon graduating, I moved back home, and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera My dream was coming true"
1458,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors They only hired perfect people But there were exceptions to the rule I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr, Ellen, and all of these women had one thing in common: they were comedians So I became a comic"
1459,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) I've performed in clubs all over America, and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East, uncensored and uncovered (Laughter) Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world I never like to claim first, but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny, and they find us hysterical"
1460,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous (Laughter) Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability My big break came in 2010 I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show ""Countdown with Keith Olbermann"
1461,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like, ""Excuse me, can I have another chair?"" And she looked at me and she went, ""Five, four, three, two "" And we were live, right? So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, I was livid I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back But not only did Mr"
1462,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," (Laughter) (Applause) One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags (Laughter) People say children are cruel, but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game I would look at clips online and see comments like, ""Yo, why's she tweakin'?"" ""Yo, is she retarded?"" And my favorite, ""Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist"
1463,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment'],""" One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits: screenwriter, comedian, palsy Disability is as visual as race If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé, then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user The disabled are the largest — Yeah, clap for that, man Come on (Applause) People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment"
1464,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," However, if I grew up with social media, I don't think I would be I hope that together, we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life Perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the Internet Or maybe not Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places"
1465,I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one,Maysoon Zayid,['entertainment']," I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC And I founded Maysoon's Kids, a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me"
1466,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture'],"What's the scariest thing you've ever done? Or another way to say it is, what's the most dangerous thing that you've ever done? And why did you do it? I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math You look back to the first five shuttle launches, the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine"
1467,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating effortlessly, gloriously in space, or you'll be dead"
1468,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad — in the Astro van — heading out to the launchpad, and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center, it's normally predawn, and in the distance, lit up by the huge xenon lights, is your spaceship — the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet"
1469,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," We ride the elevator up and we crawl in, on your hands and knees into the spaceship, one at a time, and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back And the hatch is closed, and suddenly, what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real, something that I dreamed about, in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old, is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening"
1470,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And in the astronaut business, we have a saying, which is, there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse (Laughter) And so you're very conscious in the cockpit; you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do, all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through And as the time gets closer and closer, this excitement is building"
1471,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And then about 30 seconds before launch, the vehicle is completely alive — it is ready to go — the APUs are running, the computers are all self-contained, it's ready to leave the planet"
1472,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture'], (Space shuttle taking off) Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you
1473,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines, the hydrogen and oxygen, and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated You get lighter and lighter, the force gets on us heavier and heavier It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something"
1474,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And we're alive It's an amazing experience But why would we take that risk? Why would you do something that dangerous? In my case the answer is fairly straightforward I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me, it was just an obvious thing — I want to somehow turn myself into that"
1475,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," But maybe even more importantly, allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means, to be able to look down and have — if your jaw could drop, it would — the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic, constantly changing beauty that is the world itself And you see, because of the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year"
1476,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit, and you're going through space with the world It's an entirely different perspective, you're not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going through the universe together And you're holding on with one hand, looking at the world turn beside you It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you"
1477,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," and you are holding on with one hand, one link to the other seven billion people And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind, and I didn't know why Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working I was thinking, what do I do next? I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes, so I kept working But unfortunately, without gravity, tears don't fall"
1478,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," So what's the scariest thing you've ever done? (Laughter) Maybe it's spiders A lot of people are afraid of spiders I think you should be afraid of spiders — spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs, and spiders like this one, the brown recluse — it's horrible If a brown recluse bites you, you end with one of these horrible, big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you, in fact"
1479,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," But then you could say, well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not? I don't know Are there brown recluses here? So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000 And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in BC"
1480,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And that spider — not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like ""I'm dangerous I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow"" So, if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider — and it lives close the ground, you're walking along, you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you"
1481,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn't care about you So in fact, the next time you walk into a spiderweb, you don't need to panic and go with your caveman reaction The danger is entirely different than the fear How do you get around it, though? How do you change your behavior? Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure it's not a black widow spider, and then walk into it"
1482,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff It's not a big deal And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior, your caveman reaction, and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb — or into your grandma's attic or whatever, into your own basement"
1483,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded, your natural reaction would be to panic, I think It would make you nervous and worried But we had considered all the venom, and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times"
1484,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And not just underwater, but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk, it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time And even if you're blinded, your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen Instead you kind of look around and go, ""Okay, I can't see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me"
1485,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture'],""" We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue, so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to I could find my own way back It's not nearly as big a deal And actually, if you keep on crying for a while, whatever that gunk was that's in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again, and Houston, if you negotiate with them, they will let you then keep working"
1486,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," And now we use Johnson's No More Tears, which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning (Laughter) But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger, where is the real risk? What is the real thing that you should be afraid of? Not just a generic fear of bad things happening"
1487,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," where you could see the hardpan south of the Sahara, or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike, or the unconscious gingham of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge, just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear"
1488,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," It's time to come home at the end This is our spaceship, the Soyuz, that little one Three of us climb in, and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere These two parts here actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere"
1489,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth — (Laughter) — instead, 20 years previously we had started studying Russian, and then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian, and then we learned vehicle control theory, and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again"
1490,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," So in fact, when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz, we weren't screaming, we were laughing; it was fun And when the great big parachute opened, we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute, and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism So we came back, we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan"
1491,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," Touchdown — 3:14 and 48 seconds, am Central Time CH: And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end, but you're ready for it you're in a custom-built seat, you know how the shock absorber works And then eventually the Russians reach in, drag you out, plunk you into a chair, and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience"
1492,What I learned from going blind in space,Chris Hadfield,['culture']," Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar I know this song, and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself, but it's also, I think, a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe, we are people, and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place"
1493,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology'],"Looking deeply inside nature, through the magnifying glass of science, designers extract principles, processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials, to computational methods that emulate neural processes, nature is driving design Design is also driving nature"
1494,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design As you can see, my legs are bionic Today, I will tell human stories of bionic integration; how electromechanics attached to the body, and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability, between human limitation and human potential Bionics has defined my physicality"
1495,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," At that time, I didn't view my body as broken I reasoned that a human being can never be ""broken"" Technology is broken Technology is inadequate This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms, to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability, and ultimately, the disability of others I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing"
1496,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," I made my height adjustable I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like (Laughter) So when I was feeling bad about myself, insecure, I would jack my height up (Laughter) But when I was feeling confident and suave, I would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance"
1497,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Through technological innovation, I returned to my sport, stronger and better Technology had eliminated my disability, and allowed me a new climbing prowess As a young man, I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability, a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see A world in which the paralyzed could walk, via body exoskeletons"
1498,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," This gentleman is missing three limbs As a testimony to current technology, he is out of the wheelchair, but we need to do a better job in bionics, to allow, one day, full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury At the MIT Media Lab, we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics"
1499,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Today, I'm going to tell you how my legs function, how they work, as a case in point for this center Now, I made sure to shave my legs last night, because I knew I'd be showing them off (Laughter) Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces"
1500,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," I'll begin with mechanical interface In the area of design, we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age, one of the most mature, oldest technologies in the human timeline, the shoe, still gives us blisters How can this be? We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies"
1501,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it, when you need it, for optimal support and flexibility, without ever causing discomfort My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations, that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics To achieve that mirroring, we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb"
1502,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," We also took robotic tools — here's a 14-actuator circle that goes around the biological limb The actuators come in, find the surface of the limb, measure its unloaded shape, and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb, shown on the left"
1503,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin, shown on the right And we've discovered optimality is: where the body is stiff, the synthetic skin should be soft, where the body is soft, the synthetic skin is stiff, and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances With this framework, we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn"
1504,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," In that future, our shoes will no longer give us blisters We're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins This is a material developed by SRI International, California Under electrostatic effect, it changes stiffness So under zero voltage, the material is compliant, it's floppy like paper Then the button's pushed, a voltage is applied, and it becomes stiff as a board"
1505,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," When I walk here, it's no voltage My interface is soft and compliant The button's pushed, voltage is applied, and it stiffens, offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb We're also building exoskeletons This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle, to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation"
1506,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Next, dynamic interface How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone? At my MIT lab, we study how humans with normal physiologies stand, walk and run What are the muscles doing, and how are they controlled by the spinal cord? This basic science motivates what we build We're building bionic ankles, knees and hips We're building body parts from the ground up The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs"
1507,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology'],"S soldiers How does it work? At heel strike, under computer control, the system controls stiffness, to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride, comparable to how muscles work in the calf region This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients"
1508,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway This is Steve Martin — not the comedian — who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles, that wrap around the biological limb This gentleman does not have any leg condition, any disability"
1509,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking It significantly reduces metabolic cost It's so profound in its augmentation, that when a normal, healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes and then takes it off, their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient"
1510,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," That's communicated to the bionic limb, so when I think about moving my phantom limb, the robot tracks those movement desires This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled So we model the missing biological limb, and we've discovered what reflexes occurred, how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb"
1511,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command Feels great (Applause) We want to go a step further We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves, transected nerves, through channels, or micro-channel arrays On the other side of the channel, the nerve then attaches to cells, skin cells and muscle cells"
1512,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb, then [sensory information] on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels, sensory channels So when this is fully developed and for human use, persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone, but actually feel like flesh and bone This video shows Lisa Mallette, shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs"
1513,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," (Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it! (Video) (Laughter) LM: It's just like I've got a real leg! Woman: Now, don't start running Man: Now turn around, and do the same thing walking up, but get on your heel to toe, like you would normally just walk on level ground Try to walk right up the hill LM: Oh my God Man: Is it pushing you up? LM: Yes! I'm not even — I can't even describe it Man: It's pushing you right up"
1514,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Thank you (Applause) Thank you Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing, so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it (Applause) Thank you"
1515,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose — the right to live life without severe depression; the right to see a loved one, in the case of seeing-impaired; or the right to walk or to dance, in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation"
1516,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," A person can never be broken Our built environment, our technologies, are broken and disabled We the people need not accept our limitations, but can transcend disability through technological innovation Indeed, through fundamental advances in bionics in this century, we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience, and we will end disability I'd like to finish up with one more story, a beautiful story"
1517,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack I met Adrianne when this photo was taken, at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer Adrianne breathes and lives dance It is her expression It is her art form Naturally, when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack, she wanted to return to the dance floor After meeting her and driving home in my car, I thought, I'm an MIT professor"
1518,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Let's build her a bionic limb, to enable her to go back to her life of dance I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics, robotics, machine learning and biomechanics, and over a 200-day research period, we studied dance"
1519,"The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance",Hugh Herr,['technology']," Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster Our expression, our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics It was 35 seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack In 35 seconds, the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor In 200 days, we put her back We will not be intimidated, brought down, diminished, conquered or stopped by acts of violence"
1520,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']","The Olympic motto is ""Citius, Altius, Fortius"" Faster, Higher, Stronger And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes Had he been racing against the winner of the 1904 Olympic marathon, he would have won by nearly an hour and a half"
1521,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," So what's going on here? I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress In 1936, Jesse Owens held the world record in the 100 meters Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the 100 meters, when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished, Owens would have still had 14 feet to go That's a lot in sprinter land"
1522,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the 100 meters: thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history; flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race Bang! The gun goes off An American sprinter jumps out to the front"
1523,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Usain Bolt passes him, and as the runners come to the finish, you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line (Beeps) That's the entire finish of the race You can open your eyes now That first beep was Usain Bolt That last beep was Jesse Owens Listen to it again"
1524,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Jesse Owens, on the other hand, ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood, and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran Rather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt, he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind, he would have been within one stride"
1525,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Listen to it again (Beeps) That's the difference track surface technology has made, and it's done it throughout the running world Consider a longer event In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile Nowadays, college kids do that every year On rare occasions, a high school kid does it"
1526,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks, and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub-four mile on a synthetic track, this is what happens Only 530 are left"
1527,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Now, 530 is a lot more than one, and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister, who trained for 45 minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school"
1528,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug (Laughter) Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy about performance-enhancing drugs as well, and that's made a difference in some sports at some times, but technology has made a difference in all sports, from faster skis to lighter shoes Take a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim The record is always trending downward, but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs"
1529,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Rather than stopping and turning around, athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction This second cliff, the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off, rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race This final cliff, the introduction of full-body and low-friction swimsuits"
1530,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at 30 miles, 3,774 feet Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until 1996, when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet, nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972"
1531,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Where does the record stand today? 30 miles, 4,657 feet, a grand total of 883 feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology Still, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century, the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed"
1532,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," And this showed in athletes' bodies In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper and average elite shot-putter were the same exact size"
1533,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Today, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper, the average elite shot-putter is two and a half inches taller and 130 pounds heavier And this happened throughout the sports world In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this There's some dispersal, but it's kind of grouped around that average body type"
1534,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed, and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today, it looks like this The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another"
1535,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']",""" In sports where height is prized, like basketball, the tall athletes got taller In 1983, the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league, entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be, and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships"
1536,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Today, one in 10 men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall, but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population — so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who is at least seven feet tall, there's a 17 percent chance he's in the NBA right now (Laughter) That is, find six honest seven footers, one is in the NBA right now And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique"
1537,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," My arm span is exactly equal to my height Yours is probably very nearly so But not the average NBA player The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7"", with arms that are seven feet long Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall, they are ludicrously long Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player, he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse, not a circle and a square"
1538,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Conversely, in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage, the small athletes got smaller The average elite female gymnast shrunk from 5'3"" to 4'9"" on average over the last 30 years, all the better for their power-to-weight ratio and for spinning in the air And while the large got larger and the small got smaller, the weird got weirder"
1539,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," And as the large got larger, small got smaller, and the weird weirder In swimming, the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water And the opposite is advantageous in running You want long legs and a short torso And this shows in athletes' bodies today"
1540,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," These men are seven inches different in height, but because of the body types advantaged in their sports, they wear the same length pants Seven inches difference in height, these men have the same length legs Now in some cases, the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all, like Kenyan distance runners"
1541,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']", Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners
1542,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils, to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out, and because the leg is like a pendulum, the longer and thinner it is at the extremity, the more energy-efficient it is to swing To put Kalenjin running success in perspective, consider that 17 American men in history have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes in the marathon That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace"
1543,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," (Laughter) That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta Still, even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance Athletes have a different mindset than they once did Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room? There's no explosion there"
1544,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," They're essentially jumping That's the power that's contained in the human body But normally we can't access nearly all of it Our brain acts as a limiter, preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources, because we might hurt ourselves, tearing tendons or ligaments"
1545,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health, but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra-endurance: no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running; narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames; large surface area of joints for shock absorption"
1546,"Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?",David Epstein,"['innovation', 'science']"," Our primate cousins can't do that They have to run like this And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?

1550,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," I saw this, and I thought to myself, where do people like that come from? What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion, when you would want to do that There's a love there, and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that? You know, in the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain"
1551,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," We have it backwards Right? So I asked myself, where do people like this come from? And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people That's why they're attracted to the military These better people are attracted to this concept of service But that's completely wrong"
1552,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call heroes, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, ""Why would you do it? Why did you do it?"" And they all say the same thing: ""Because they would have done it for me"" It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation So trust and cooperation are really important here"
1553,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," I can't simply say to you, ""Trust me,"" and you will I can't simply instruct two people to cooperate, and they will It's not how it works It's a feeling So where does that feeling come from? If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era, to the early days of Homo sapiens, what we find is that the world was filled with danger, all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us Nothing personal"
1554,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged And when we felt safe amongst our own, the natural reaction was trust and cooperation There are inherent benefits to this It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger"
1555,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," Bad system of survival The modern day is exactly the same thing The world is filled with danger, things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success, reduce our opportunity for success It could be the ups and downs in the economy, the uncertainty of the stock market It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you"
1556,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," We have no control over these forces These are a constant, and they're not going away The only variable are the conditions inside the organization, and that's where leadership matters, because it's the leader that sets the tone"

Why can't you treat us like human beings?"" And this is exactly what she said to me"
1558,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business'],""" All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people It's because they don't fear their leaders You see, if the conditions are wrong, we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other, and that inherently weakens the organization"
1559,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is, is like being a parent If you think about what being a great parent is, what do you want? What makes a great parent? We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves Great leaders want exactly the same thing"
1560,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City, a tech company, he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family, would you ever consider laying off one of your children? We would never do it Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization? Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment If you get a job at Next Jump, you cannot get fired for performance issues"
1561,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," It's the complete opposite This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred, anger, at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures It's not the numbers It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership They have violated this deep-seated social contract"
1562,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," This is what so offends us, not the numbers Would anybody be offended if we gave a $150 million bonus to Gandhi? How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa? Do we have an issue with that? None at all None at all Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people"
1563,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," Now in a large manufacturing company, this is a big deal, and they could no longer afford their labor pool They needed to save 10 million dollars, so, like so many companies today, the board got together and discussed layoffs And Bob refused You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts Bob believes in heart counts, and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count And so they came up with a furlough program"
1564,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," They could take it any time they wanted, and they did not have to take it consecutively But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot, and morale went up"
1565,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three Leadership is a choice It is not a rank I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders"
1566,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders, and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them, and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them This is what a leader is"
1567,Why good leaders make you feel safe,Simon Sinek,['business']," And when they went back out in the field, his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat, because that's what happens We call them leaders because they go first We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does"
1568,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture'],"The human voice: It's the instrument we all play It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably It's the only one that can start a war or say ""I love you"" And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them And why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from"
1569,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into First, gossip Speaking ill of somebody who's not present Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us Second, judging"
1570,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Third, negativity You can fall into this My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it's hard to listen I remember one day, I said to her, ""It's October 1 today,"" and she said, ""I know, isn't it dreadful?"" (Laughter) It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative (Laughter) And another form of negativity, complaining Well, this is the national art of the UK It's our national sport"
1571,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world Excuses We've all met this guy Maybe we've all been this guy Some people have a blamethrower They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration It demeans our language, actually, sometimes"
1572,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," And finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true It's difficult to listen to that So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking These are things I think we need to avoid But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is"
1573,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Fortunately, these things spell a word The word is ""hail,"" and it has a great definition as well I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things So what do they stand for? See if you can guess"
1574,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," The A is authenticity, just being yourself A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust And the L is love I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want"
1575,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Perhaps that's not necessary Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously So hail Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it You have an amazing toolbox"
1576,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking Register, for example Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches You can locate your voice, however"
1577,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority That's register Then we have timbre It's the way your voice feels Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate"
1578,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Go and get a voice coach And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice Then prosody I love prosody This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning It's root one for meaning in conversation People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all"
1579,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit Pace"
1580,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs It can be very powerful Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries And finally, volume (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume"
1581,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet Some people broadcast the whole time Try not to do that That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately Not nice Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people"
1582,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up Warm up your voice Actually, let me show you how to do that Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these"
1583,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," One more time Ahhhh, very good Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba Very good And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid Brrrr Now your lips should be coming alive We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Beautiful You're getting really good at this And then, roll an R Rrrrrrr That's like champagne for the tongue"
1584,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture']," It's really good It starts with ""we"" and goes to ""aw"" The ""we"" is high, the ""aw"" is low So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww Fantastic Give yourselves a round of applause Take a seat, thank you (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance Now let me just put this in context to close This is a serious point here"
1585,How to speak so that people want to listen,Julian Treasure,['culture'], I have talked about that on this stage in different phases
1586,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business'],"The power of yet I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate, and if they didn't pass a course, they got the grade ""Not Yet"" And I thought that was fantastic, because if you get a failing grade, you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere But if you get the grade ""Not Yet"", you understand that you're on a learning curve It gives you a path into the future"
1587,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty, so I gave 10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way They said things like, ""I love a challenge,"" or, ""You know, I was hoping this would be informative"" They understood that their abilities could be developed They had what I call a growth mindset But other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic"
1588,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet, they were gripped in the tyranny of now So what do they do next? I'll tell you what they do next In one study, they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test In another study, after a failure, they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves And in study after study, they have run from difficulty"
1589,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," On the left, you see the fixed-mindset students There's hardly any activity They run from the error They don't engage with it But on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset, the idea that abilities can be developed They engage deeply Their brain is on fire with yet They engage deeply They process the error They learn from it and they correct it"
1590,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business'],""" So what can we do? How can we build that bridge to yet? Here are some things we can do First of all, we can praise wisely, not praising intelligence or talent That has failed Don't do that anymore But praising the process that kids engage in, their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their improvement This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient There are other ways to reward yet"
1591,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," In this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right, right now, but this game rewarded process And we got more effort, more strategies, more engagement over longer periods of time, and more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems"
1592,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," And we can actually change students' mindsets In one study, we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections, and over time, they can get smarter"
1593,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," We have shown this now, this kind of improvement, with thousands and thousands of kids, especially struggling students So let's talk about equality In our country, there are groups of students who chronically underperform, for example, children in inner cities, or children on Native American reservations And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable"
1594,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," And here are just a few examples In one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York scored in the 95th percentile on the national achievement test Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school In one year, fourth-grade students in the South Bronx, way behind, became the number one fourth-grade class in the state of New York on the state math test"
1595,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," So the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed Before, effort and difficulty made them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up, but now, effort and difficulty, that's when their neurons are making new connections, stronger connections That's when they're getting smarter I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy"
1596,The power of believing that you can improve,Carol Dweck,['business']," I put more effort into my schoolwork, into my relationship with my family, and into my relationship with kids at school, and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas I now realize I've wasted most of my life"
1597,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health'],"I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism If his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions And clearly, I wasn't starving (Laughter) When I became a psychologist, I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value the body than we do the mind"
1598,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," So, not a real doctor,"" as if it should say that on my card [Dr Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist (Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body over the mind — I see it everywhere I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old was getting ready for bed He was standing on a stool by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell"
1599,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," Now, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since we were five years old But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health? Well, nothing What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene? Nothing"
1600,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," And they can also get worse if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways And yet, even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries, we don't It doesn't even occur to us that we should ""Oh, you're feeling depressed? Just shake it off; it's all in your head"" Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg: ""Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg"
1601,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," It's time we made them more equal, more like twins Speaking of which, my brother is also a psychologist So he's not a real doctor, either (Laughter) We didn't study together, though In fact, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology We were apart then for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal for both of us"
1602,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week When our birthday rolled around, it was the first we wouldn't be spending together We decided to splurge, and that week, we would talk for 10 minutes (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room, waiting for him to call — and waiting  and waiting But the phone didn't ring"
1603,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health'],""" There were no cell phones then But he didn't And I began to realize that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me the way I missed him I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life I woke up the next morning I glanced down at the phone, and I realized I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before"
1604,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest night of his life as well Now, I tried to explain what happened, but he said, ""I don't understand If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up the phone and call me?"" He was right Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness"
1605,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand? I was in the grips of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day, so it never occurred to me But loneliness is defined purely subjectively"
1606,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," And I did There is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you I'm not kidding Chronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol It even suppress the functioning of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases"
1607,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," Now, cigarette packs come with warnings saying, ""This could kill you"" But loneliness doesn't And that's why it's so important that we prioritize our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene Because you can't treat a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured Loneliness isn't the only psychological wound that distorts our perceptions and misleads us Failure does that as well"
1608,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," You had to slide the red button, and a cute doggie would pop out One little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling The little boy next to her watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it"
1609,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," So: three toddlers with identical plastic toys, but with very different reactions to failure The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time"
1610,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure? You need to be Because if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers, you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon, or you won't even try at all And then you'll be even more convinced you can't succeed You see, that's why so many people function below their actual potential"
1611,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," Once we become convinced of something, it's very difficult to change our mind I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother We were driving with friends down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects The officer approached the car, and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me"
1612,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health'],""" (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car, he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified I didn't have a police record, could I show him I had a twin in the front seat But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something"
1613,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health'], So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail But you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed You have to fight feelings of helplessness You have to gain control over the situation And you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings — they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were
1614,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," I once worked with this woman who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice and he seemed successful, and most importantly, he seemed really into her So she was very excited, she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink Ten minutes into the date, the man stands up and says, ""I'm not interested,"" and walks out"
1615,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," The woman was so hurt she couldn't move All she could do was call a friend Here's what the friend said: ""Well, what do you expect? You have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say Why would a handsome, successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?"" Shocking, right, that a friend could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't the friend who said that It's what the woman said to herself"
1616,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't We call ourselves names Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem is already hurting Why would we want to go and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury worse on purpose"
1617,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health'],""" But we do that with psychological injuries all the time Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene Because we don't prioritize our psychological health We know from dozens of studies that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them"
1618,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them And one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination To ruminate means to chew over"
1619,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," Now, ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease"
1620,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago, I developed the habit myself You see, my twin brother was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma His cancer was extremely aggressive He had visible tumors all over his body And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy And I couldn't stop thinking about what he was going through"
1621,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," He had this incredibly positive attitude His psychological health was amazing I was physically healthy, but psychologically, I was a mess But I knew what to do Studies tell us that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment And so each time I had a worrying, upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed"
1622,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy, my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side when he got the results All the tumors were gone He still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover This picture was taken two weeks ago"
1623,Why we all need to practice emotional first aid,Guy Winch,['health']," A hundred years ago, people began practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing emotional hygiene"
1624,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']","You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade Obviously, that's changed, but only recently It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk, at the Forbes ""30 Under 30 Summit"" — 1,500 brilliant people, all under the age of 30 That meant that in 1998, the oldest among the group were only 14, and the youngest, just four I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs"
1625,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," (Laughter) Almost 40 rap songs (Laughter) But the night of my speech, a surprising thing happened At the age of 41, I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy (Laughter) I know, right? He was charming, and I was flattered, and I declined You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was? He could make me feel 22 again (Laughter) (Applause) I realized, later that night, I'm probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again"
1626,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," And at the age of 24, I learned the devastating consequences Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22? Yep That's what I thought So like me, at 22, a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person, maybe even your boss Unlike me, though, your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America"
1627,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake, and I regret that mistake deeply In 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance, I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before Remember, just a few years earlier, news was consumed from just three places: reading a newspaper or magazine, listening to the radio or watching television That was it"
1628,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Instead, this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution That meant we could access all the information we wanted, when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere And when the story broke in January 1998, it broke online It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story — a click that reverberated around the world"
1629,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously This rush to judgment, enabled by technology, led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers Granted, it was before social media, but people could still comment online, e-mail stories, and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers, banner ads online, and to keep people tuned to the TV"
1630,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," (Laughter) But the attention and judgment that I received — not the story, but that I personally received — was unprecedented I was branded as a tramp, tart, slut, whore, bimbo, and, of course, ""that woman"" I was seen by many, but actually known by few And I get it: it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional, had a soul and was once unbroken When this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it"
1631,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']",""" Today, I want to share some of my experience with you, talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations, and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others In 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity I lost almost everything And I almost lost my life Let me paint a picture for you It is September of 1998"
1632,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," I'm listening to the sound of my voice, my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before I'm here because I've been legally required to personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation For the past eight months, the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword of Damocles over my head"
1633,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," A few days later, the Starr Report is released to Congress, and all of those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough But a few weeks later, the audiotapes are aired on TV, and significant portions made available online The public humiliation was excruciating Life was almost unbearable"
1634,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010, and now social media has been born The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine, whether or not someone actually made a mistake, and now, it's for both public and private people The consequences for some have become dire, very dire"

1636,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Today, too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation after it was too late Tyler's tragic, senseless death was a turning point for me It served to recontextualize my experiences, and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different"
1637,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Since then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways — joining lost siblings, saving lives, launching revolutions  But the darkness, cyberbullying, and slut-shaming that I experienced had mushroomed Every day online, people — especially young people, who are not developmentally equipped to handle this — are so abused and humiliated that they can't imagine living to the next day And some, tragically, don't"
1638,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Childline, a UK nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues, released a staggering statistic late last year: from 2012 to 2013, there was an 87 percent increase in calls and e-mails related to cyberbullying A meta-analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time, cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying"
1639,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Cruelty to others is nothing new But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family, village, school or community But now, it's the online community too Millions of people, often anonymously, can stab you with their words, and that's a lot of pain"
1640,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," There is a very personal price to public humiliation, and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price For nearly two decades now, we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil, both on- and offline Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics, news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame"
1641,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls ""a culture of humiliation"" Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone Snapchat, the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the life span of a few seconds You can imagine the range of content that that gets"
1642,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked, and private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking? The documents which received the most attention were private e-mails that had maximum public embarrassment value"
1643,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," The price does not measure the cost to the victim, which Tyler and too many others — notably, women, minorities and members of the LGBTQ community — have paid, but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them This invasion of others is a raw material, efficiently and ruthlessly mined, packaged and sold at a profit A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity, and shame is an industry How is the money made? Clicks"
1644,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," The more clicks, the more advertising dollars We're in a dangerous cycle The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it And the more numb we get, the more we click All the while, someone is making money off of the back of someone else's suffering With every click, we make a choice"
1645,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Why? Because they all have humiliation at their cores This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created Just think about it Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs We've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia and plenty of other biases, today and in the past As we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage, more people have been offered equal freedoms When we began valuing sustainability, more people began to recycle"
1646,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop, and it's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture The shift begins with something simple, but it's not easy We need to return to a long-held value of compassion, compassion and empathy Online, we've got a compassion deficit, an empathy crisis Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote, ""Shame can't survive empathy"" Shame cannot survive empathy I've seen some very dark days in my life"
1647,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," Even empathy from one person can make a difference The theory of minority influence, proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici, says that even in small numbers, when there's consistency over time, change can happen In the online world, we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy, we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation"
1648,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues, like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the US; in the UK, there's Anti-Bullying Pro; and in Australia, there's PROJECT ROCKIT We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression But we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression"
1649,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," The internet is the superhighway for the id But online, showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world We need to communicate online with compassion, consume news with compassion and click with compassion Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline I'd like to end on a personal note"
1650,The price of shame,Monica Lewinsky,"['communication', 'technology']"," The top-note answer was and is ""Because it's time"" Time to stop tiptoeing around my past, time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative It's also not just about saving myself Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing: You can survive it I know it's hard It may not be painless, quick or easy, but you can insist on a different ending to your story Have compassion for yourself"
1651,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues'],"When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this Instead, it looks like this"
1652,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," Not missiles, but microbes Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic We're not ready for the next epidemic Let's look at Ebola I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication"
1653,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread The case reports came in on paper It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate We didn't have a medical team ready to go We didn't have a way of preparing people"
1654,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers There was no one there to look at treatment approaches No one to look at the diagnostics No one to figure out what tools should be used"
1655,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," But that was never tried So there was a lot that was missing And these things are really a global failure The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about Now, in the movies it's quite different There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood"
1656,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries There's three reasons why it didn't spread more The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers They found the people and they prevented more infections The second is the nature of the virus Ebola does not spread through the air And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden"
1657,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," And that was just luck If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger So next time, we might not be so lucky You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse"
1658,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic So this is a serious problem We should be concerned But in fact, we can build a really good response system We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them"
1659,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system And we need preparedness The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again, what we do for war For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go"
1660,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained? Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies? So they are absolutely ready to go So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic What are the key pieces? First, we need strong health systems in poor countries That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines"
1661,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go, with the expertise And then we need to pair those medical people with the military taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics and secure areas We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are"
1662,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0 Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus, that could work very, very quickly Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost, but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm"
1663,The next outbreak? We're not ready,Bill Gates,['global issues']," These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic The primary healthcare, the R&D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe So I think this should absolutely be a priority There's no need to panic We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement But we need to get going, because time is not on our side"
1664,How to control someone else's arm with your brain,Greg Gage,"['science', 'technology']","The brain is an amazing and complex organ And while many people are fascinated by the brain, they can't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don't teach neuroscience in schools And one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it's really only done at major universities and large institutions"
1665,How to control someone else's arm with your brain,Greg Gage,"['science', 'technology']"," And that's a shame because one out of five of us, that's 20 percent of the entire world, will have a neurological disorder And there are zero cures for these diseases And so it seems that what we should be doing is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future, they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist"
1666,How to control someone else's arm with your brain,Greg Gage,"['science', 'technology']"," And so we did just that A few years ago, we started a company called Backyard Brains and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight, and I want to do some demonstrations You guys want to see some?

1674,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture'],
1675,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple of their relationship, their happiness and their very identity: an affair And yet, this extremely common act is so poorly understood So this talk is for anyone who has ever loved Adultery has existed since marriage was invented, and so, too, the taboo against it"
1676,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," (Laughter) So how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden, yet universally practiced? Now, throughout history, men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence, and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam, so the double standard is as old as adultery itself"
1677,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," Now, monogamy used to be one person for life Today, monogamy is one person at a time (Laughter) (Applause) I mean, many of you probably have said, ""I am monogamous in all my relationships"" (Laughter) We used to marry, and had sex for the first time But now we marry, and we stop having sex with others The fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love"
1678,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," Now, everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat I've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference (Laughter) It applies to you But the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding: sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps So because there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity, estimates vary widely, from 26 percent to 75 percent"
1679,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," So 95 percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair, but just about the same amount of us will say that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one (Laughter) Now, I like this definition of an affair — it brings together the three key elements: a secretive relationship, which is the core structure of an affair; an emotional connection to one degree or another; and a sexual alchemy"
1680,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," As Marcel Proust said, it's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person So it's never been easier to cheat, and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened our economic security But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens our emotional security"
1681,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it Now, there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs: to be my greatest lover, my best friend, the best parent, my trusted confidant, my emotional companion, my intellectual equal And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique, I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable, I'm the one"
1682,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," It is the ultimate betrayal Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love But if throughout history, infidelity has always been painful, today it is often traumatic, because it threatens our sense of self So my patient Fernando, he's plagued He goes on: ""I thought I knew my life I thought I knew who you were, who we were as a couple, who I was Now, I question everything"" Infidelity — a violation of trust, a crisis of identity"
1683,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," ""Can I ever trust anyone again?"" And this is also what my patient Heather is telling me, when she's talking to me about her story with Nick Married, two kids Nick just left on a business trip, and Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys, when she sees a message appear on the screen: ""Can't wait to see you"" Strange, she thinks, we just saw each other And then another message: ""Can't wait to hold you in my arms"
1684,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," She also tells me that her father had affairs, but her mother, she found one little receipt in the pocket, and a little bit of lipstick on the collar Heather, she goes digging, and she finds hundreds of messages, and photos exchanged and desires expressed The vivid details of Nick's two-year affair unfold in front of her in real time, And it made me think: Affairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts"
1685,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," Because of this romantic ideal, we are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor But we also have never been more inclined to stray, and not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires, because this is the culture where I deserve to be happy And if we used to divorce because we were unhappy, today we divorce because we could be happier"
1686,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," So Heather, she can't talk to her friends because she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick, and everywhere she turns, she gets the same advice: Leave him Throw the dog on the curb And if the situation were reversed, Nick would be in the same situation Staying is the new shame"
1687,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," But millions of people can't all be pathological The logic goes like this: If you have everything you need at home, then there is no need to go looking elsewhere, assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust"
1688,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," They are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs, and at least for their partner But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior They often are people who have actually been faithful for decades, but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross, and at the risk of losing everything"
1689,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," At the heart of an affair, you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy I'm thinking about another patient of mine, Priya, who is blissfully married, loves her husband, and would never want to hurt the man"
1690,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," Priya, she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy And with his truck and his tattoos, he's quite the opposite of her But at 47, Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had And her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another, it isn't always our partner that we are turning away from, but the person that we have ourselves become"
1691,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," Now, all over the world, there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me They feel alive And they often will tell me stories of recent losses — of a parent who died, and a friend that went too soon, and bad news at the doctor Death and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair, because they raise these questions"
1692,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," And contrary to what you may think, affairs are way less about sex, and a lot more about desire: desire for attention, desire to feel special, desire to feel important And the very structure of an affair, the fact that you can never have your lover, keeps you wanting That in itself is a desire machine, because the incompleteness, the ambiguity, keeps you wanting that which you can't have"
1693,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," First of all, the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity But the fact is that it seems that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners, we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden, that if we do that which we are not supposed to do, then we feel like we are really doing what we want to"
1694,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," (Laughter) So how do we heal from an affair? Desire runs deep Betrayal runs deep But it can be healed And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were already dying on the vine But others will jolt us into new possibilities The fact is, the majority of couples who have experienced affairs stay together But some of them will merely survive, and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity"
1695,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," And I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner, who will often say, ""You think I didn't want more? But I'm not the one who did it"" But now that the affair is exposed, they, too, get to claim more, and they no longer have to uphold the status quo that may not have been working for them that well, either"
1696,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," And, partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious, they don't know where it's coming from Something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire, and make way for an entirely new kind of truth So when an affair is exposed, what are some of the specific things that couples can do? We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing"
1697,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner, but they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself And that distinction is important And Nick, he needs to hold vigil for the relationship He needs to become, for a while, the protector of the boundaries"
1698,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," But for Heather, or deceived partners, it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth, to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity But even more important, is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details — Where were you? Where did you do it? How often? Is she better than me in bed? — questions that only inflict more pain, and keep you awake at night"
1699,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," But affairs are here to stay, and they're not going away And the dilemmas of love and desire, they don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad, and victim and perpetrator Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms There are many ways that we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner"
1700,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," Now, you've listened to me, and I know what you're thinking: She has a French accent, she must be pro-affair (Laughter) So, you're wrong I am not French (Laughter) (Applause) And I'm not pro-affair"
1701,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,['culture']," The main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is, for or against? I said, ""Yes"" (Laughter) I look at affairs from a dual perspective: hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other — what it did to you, and what it meant for me"
1702,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']","One of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why, but as I got older, I realized we had drug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction"
1703,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," It's a century since we made this really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them"
1704,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them — it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances — to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal"
1705,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew Let's think about this middle row here Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect (Laughter) Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment Imagine you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century"
1706,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," Right? That's what I thought First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine Diamorphine is heroin It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated"
1707,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening And if what we believe about addiction is right — those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks — What should happen? They should become addicts This has been studied really carefully"
1708,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," (Laughter) And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us to understand this issue"
1709,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," They're really simple You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly So there you go, right? That's how we think it works"
1710,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage It's got nothing to do except use these drugs Let's try something different So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called ""Rat Park,"" which is basically heaven for rats They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels Crucially, they've got loads of friends They can have loads of sex"
1711,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water They almost never use it None of them ever use it compulsively None of them ever overdose You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us"
1712,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," It was called the Vietnam War In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home"
1713,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," They didn't go into withdrawal Ninety-five percent of them just stopped Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction"
1714,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," Maybe we should call it bonding Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief"
1715,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," That's what we want as human beings And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped me to think about it is, I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right? I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you Forget the drugs Forget the drug war"
1716,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months You wouldn't end up homeless You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for You've got work you love"
1717,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," You've got healthy relationships And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear to be present in your life Now, this has really significant implications The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs"
1718,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that We punish them We shame them We give them criminal records We put barriers between them reconnecting There was a doctor in Canada, Dr Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system"
1719,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing, and every year, they tried the American way more and more They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse"
1720,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']", Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr
1721,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']",""" And that's not really what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy, that does have some value But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do: a massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses So say you used to be a mechanic"
1722,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal, what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society"
1723,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts Addiction in every study is significantly down One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system Now, that's the political implications I actually think there's a layer of implications to all this research below that"
1724,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," Before these talks began — you guys know this — we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours"
1725,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round"
1726,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing, and I think that's like a metaphor for the choice we've made as a culture"
1727,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says, we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery, and it's right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more about social recovery Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group, and we've created a society where, for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park"
1728,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff I wanted to know how to help the people I love And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this, I looked at the addicts in my life, and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room"
1729,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," And the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by, I think, the reality show ""Intervention,"" if you guys have ever seen it I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV, but that's another TED Talk If you've ever seen the show ""Intervention,"" it's a pretty simple premise"
1730,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," So what they do is they take the connection to the addict, and they threaten it, they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work, and I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives"
1731,Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,Johann Hari,"['culture', 'society']"," I love you, whatever state you're in, and if you need me, I'll come and sit with you because I love you and I don't want you to be alone or to feel alone And I think the core of that message — you're not alone, we love you — has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts"
1732,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']","Well, we all need a reason to wake up For me, it just took 11,000 volts I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time We'd certainly done stupider things"
1733,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! (Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity That night began my formal relationship with death — my death — and it also began my long run as a patient It's a good word It means one who suffers So I guess we're all patients Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction — to match its brilliance, to be sure"
1734,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well — I mean, truly But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed"
1735,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," There are no do-overs My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die So let's begin at the end"
1736,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," It's a key distinction To get underneath this, it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing"
1737,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," It took me a while, but I learned it eventually Now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver — human beings This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens Yes, compassion — literally, as we learned yesterday — suffering together Now, on the systems side, on the other hand, so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented It serves no good purpose"
1738,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," How we die is indeed something we can affect Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care, is to relieve suffering — not add to the pile True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician"
1739,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," It is not limited to hospice It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care Now, let me introduce you to Frank Sort of makes this point I've been seeing Frank now for years He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV"
1740,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," In this way, Frank grieves In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in the next moment Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another Frank has always been an adventurer — he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting — and no fan of regret So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River"
1741,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Many did, but he went for it, while he still could It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon — all the glorious side of the world beyond our control Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time"
1742,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," After my accident, when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see — a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower"
1743,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause Anyone who wants — fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now — shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance"
1744,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness — anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them But we ask too much of our hospitals"
1745,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for Now mind you — I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane Beauty can be found anywhere I spent a few months in a burn unit at St Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really great care at every turn, including good palliative care for my pain And one night, it began to snow outside"
1746,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me She brought it in to the unit I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water"
1747,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not In a hospital, that's a stolen moment In my work over the years, I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become — in a word, cut off, or ugly"
1748,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population Now is the time to create something new, something vital I know we can because we have to The alternative is just unacceptable And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with"
1749,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail Little things aren't so little Take Janette She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again — and French cigarettes, if you please Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled while she has them Priorities change"
1750,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body — the very thing doing the living and the dying Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all"
1751,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof, one of the most tried and true interventions we know of, is to bake cookies As long as we have our senses — even just one — we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia"
1752,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity by way of the senses, by way of the body — the aesthetic realm — is design cue number two Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible"
1753,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care, and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative, even playful act ""Play"" may sound like a funny word here But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human The need for food has birthed cuisine The need for shelter has given rise to architecture"
1754,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music So, since dying is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By ""play"" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move, and one way or another, we will all kneel there"
1755,What really matters at the end of life,BJ Miller,"['global issues', 'health']"," We can't solve for death I know some of you are working on this (Laughter) Meanwhile, we can — (Laughter) We can design towards it Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say one way or another"
1756,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']","Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells? There's still some confusion about that question, as this is a fairly new field of research For example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert, who is an oncologist, and he was telling me, ""Sandrine, this is puzzling Some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression"" And I responded to him, ""Well, from my point of view that makes sense"
1757,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']",""" And then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""But Sandrine, these are adult patients — adults do not grow new nerve cells"" And much to his surprise, I said, ""Well actually, we do"" And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis [Neurogenesis] Now Robert is not a neuroscientist, and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now — that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells"
1758,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis — and this is the hippocampus So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain And what we've known already for very long, is that this is important for learning, memory, mood and emotion However, what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated"
1759,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," So when it comes to the human brain — my colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet, has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus You might think this is not much, compared to the billions of neurons we have But by the time we turn 50, we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons"
1760,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities And this is especially new and true for spatial recognition — so like, how you navigate your way in the city We are still learning a lot, and neurons are not only important for memory capacity, but also for the quality of the memory"
1761,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," So in an animal model of depression, we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production of these newborn neurons, and we decrease the symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression But moreover, if you just block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant"
1762,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," And it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal functions So, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline associated with aging, or associated with stress So the next question is: can we control neurogenesis? The answer is yes And we are now going to do a little quiz"
1763,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," Are we ready? OK, let's go So what about learning? Increasing? Yes Learning will increase the production of these new neurons How about stress? Yes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus How about sleep deprivation? Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis How about sex? Oh, wow! (Laughter) Yes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons However, it's all about balance here"
1764,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," (Laughter) How about getting older? So the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older, but it is still occurring And then finally, how about running? I will let you judge that one by yourself So this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors, Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute, showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons"
1765,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be And now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be So activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus"
1766,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," And I'm just going to point a few out to you: Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis Intermittent fasting — spacing the time between your meals — will increase neurogenesis Intake of flavonoids, which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries, will increase neurogenesis Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty fish, like salmon, will increase the production of these new neurons"
1767,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," Ethanol — intake of alcohol — will decrease neurogenesis However, not everything is lost; resveratrol, which is contained in red wine, has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons So next time you are at a dinner party, you might want to reach for this possibly ""neurogenesis-neutral"" drink (Laughter) And then finally, let me point out the last one — a quirky one"
1768,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," So all of this data, where we need to look at the cellular level, has been generated using animal models"
1769,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," So we think that the effect of diet on mental health, on memory and mood, is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus And it's not only what you eat, but it's also the texture of the food, when you eat it and how much of it you eat On our side — neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis — we need to understand better the function of these new neurons, and how we can control their survival and their production"
1770,You can grow new brain cells. Here's how,Sandrine Thuret,"['health', 'science']"," And on your side — I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis Thank you (Applause) Margaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine Now, I told you you changed my life — I now eat a lot of blueberries Sandrine Thuret: Very good MH: I'm really interested in the running thing"
1771,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health'],"A few years ago, I broke into my own house I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees — and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet — it was very cold And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys"
1772,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight I thought about calling a locksmith — at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up, and it was cold I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase"
1773,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking"
1774,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," (Laughter) And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport (Laughter) So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes, got my passport, raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight"
1775,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," (Laughter) And I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later"
1776,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," (Laughter) It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-mortem Now, you all know what the postmortem is"
1777,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious I'll start with the obvious ones Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works"
1778,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things"
1779,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports So in the home, designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl For your passport, a particular drawer For your reading glasses, a particular table If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them"
1780,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement Now these are some rather obvious things Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place"
1781,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision And so I want to talk about that And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition"
1782,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, ""I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high"" Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, ""You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin"
1783,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," And so you're thinking, ""Yeah! Give me the statin"" But there's a question you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less It's for the number needed to treat Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped"
1784,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people"
1785,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloombergcom I ran through the numbers myself 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented Now you're probably thinking, ""Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway"
1786,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health'],""" Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients And they include terrible things — debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress — but now you're thinking, ""Five percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug"" But wait a minute Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly"
1787,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," 300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped, five percent of those 300 have side effects, that's 15 people You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed consent"
1788,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49 That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients"
1789,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot And you also want to think about things like quality of life"
1790,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," You might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down There's an evolutionary reason for this"
1791,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed We all are going to fail now and then"
1792,How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed,Daniel Levitin,['health']," Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal, when I got back from my trip, I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through So I'm not completely organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm getting there"

Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20"
1795,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']", But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy? We did that The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done
1796,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," Studies like this are exceedingly rare Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived"

1798,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed They were given medical exams We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States Some developed alcoholism"

1801,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time"" (Laughter) So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder"
1802,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," Period We've learned three big lessons about relationships The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic"
1803,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters"
1804,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't"
1805,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," It was how satisfied they were in their relationships The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80 And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy"
1806,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer"
1807,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills"
1808,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous It's also lifelong It never ends The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates"
1809,What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,"['health', 'humanity', 'society']"," But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community So what about you?

1824,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']","When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered, to bring it back Sounded simple enough Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work Actually, it was exhausting The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important"
1825,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this We see some food that looks good, our brain says, ""Calories!  Survival!"" We eat the food, we taste it — it tastes good"
1826,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']",""" We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time See food, eat food, feel good, repeat Trigger, behavior, reward Simple, right? Well, after a while, our creative brains say, ""You know what? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is"
1827,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," Same process, just a different trigger Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal — feeling sad — triggers that urge to eat Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, ""Hey, I want to be cool"" So we start smoking The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good Repeat Trigger, behavior, reward"
1828,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world So back to my breath"
1829,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience? I'll give you an example In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking And the majority of them had tried this before and failed — on average, six times"
1830,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," In fact, we even told them to smoke What? Yeah, we said, ""Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do"" And what did they notice? Well here's an example from one of our smokers She said, ""Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!"" Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program"
1831,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," (Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken She started to become disenchanted with her behavior Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke"
1832,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," We call this cognitive control We're using cognition to control our behavior Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful We just can't help ourselves"
1833,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']", Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level — to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior We're just less interested in doing it in the first place
1834,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment"
1835,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding What does curiosity feel like? It feels good And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations — oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness — and that these body sensations come and go"
1836,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking So it actually works"
1837,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride In contrast, when we let go — step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening — this same brain region quiets down"
1838,A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,"['health', 'science']"," Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises"

1850,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," In this case, take a cue from journalists Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out If I ask you, ""Were you terrified?"" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is ""terrified,"" and the answer is ""Yes, I was"" or ""No, I wasn't"" ""Were you angry?"" ""Yes, I was very angry"" Let them describe it They're the ones that know"
1851,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," Number four: Go with the flow That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered"
1852,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," And we do the exact same thing We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop (Laughter) And we stop listening Stories and ideas are going to come to you You need to let them come and let them go Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know"
1853,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," Do that Err on the side of caution Talk should not be cheap Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job It's not the same It is never the same All experiences are individual"
1854,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, ""I have no idea People who brag about their IQs are losers"" (Laughter) Conversations are not a promotional opportunity Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot"
1855,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," Don't do that Number eight: Stay out of the weeds Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind They don't care What they care about is you They care about what you're like, what you have in common So forget the details Leave them out Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one Listen"
1856,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""If your mouth is open, you're not learning"" And Calvin Coolidge said, ""No man ever listened his way out of a job"" (Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk When I'm talking, I'm in control I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in I'm the center of attention I can bolster my own identity But there's another reason: We get distracted"
1857,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication']," So our minds are filling in those other 275 words And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place (Laughter) You have to listen to one another Stephen Covey said it very beautifully He said, ""Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand"
1858,10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,['communication'],""" One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief [A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject — My Sister] (Laughter) (Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home"

1862,Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future,Raffaello D'Andrea,"['design', 'future', 'technology']"," Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab There are no external cameras"
1863,Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future,Raffaello D'Andrea,"['design', 'future', 'technology']"," The only external commands are high-level ones such as ""take off"" and ""land"" This is a so-called tail-sitter It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility"
1864,Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future,Raffaello D'Andrea,"['design', 'future', 'technology']"," One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time (Applause) OK"
1865,Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future,Raffaello D'Andrea,"['design', 'future', 'technology']"," For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight? Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm"

1867,Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future,Raffaello D'Andrea,"['design', 'future', 'technology']"," Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night"
1868,Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future,Raffaello D'Andrea,"['design', 'future', 'technology']"," What can you do with all this surplus? The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation This gives it an extraordinary capability It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers"

1872,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment'],"So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this So, you know — (Laughter) you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil (Laughter) And I would want to do that like that That would be the plan"
1873,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option It was way too big a project So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this This is how the year would go"
1874,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff So we had an awesome new revised plan (Laughter) And then — (Laughter) But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks"
1875,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," I thought that was the end of everything But a week later I get a call, and it's the school And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"" And I say, ""Yeah"" And they say, ""We need to talk about your thesis"" And I say, ""OK"" And they say, ""It's the best one we've ever seen"" (Laughter) (Applause) That did not happen (Laughter) It was a very, very bad thesis"
1876,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy I write the blog Wait But Why And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are"
1877,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them I actually brought them here to show you today I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator (Laughter) Now  here's my brain"
1878,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens [This is a perfect time to get some work done"
1879,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Then — (Laughter) Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom"
1880,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," Sorry!"" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel He lives entirely in the present moment He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun Now, in the animal world, that works fine"
1881,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do We can visualize the future"
1882,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," We can make long-term plans And he wants to take all of that into account And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time That's why there's an overlap Sometimes they agree"
1883,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," And that's when we have a conflict And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle I call it the Dark Playground (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well"
1884,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred — all of those good procrastinator feelings"
1885,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk"
1886,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind He was saying, ""Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now"
1887,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment'],""" (Laughter) So that's what we did that day (Laughter) As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem"
1888,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages And this entire situation, with the three characters — this is the procrastinator's system It's not pretty, but in the end, it works"
1889,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," When I did, I was amazed by the response Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students (Laughter) And they were all writing, saying the same thing: ""I have this problem too"
1890,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines"
1891,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter — something in the arts, something entrepreneurial — there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going"
1892,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever"
1893,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," It's usually suffered quietly and privately And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place It's not that they're cramming for some project It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives"
1894,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don't think non-procrastinators exist That's right — I think all of you are procrastinators Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there Now, I want to show you one last thing I call this a Life Calendar"
1895,Inside the mind of a master procrastinator,Tim Urban,['entertainment']," That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey That's a job for all of us And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today"
1896,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']","Seven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company He said, ""I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online"" And I said, ""OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?"" ""No, we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out"" ""All right, but you're going to go in full time once you graduate"" ""Not exactly We've all lined up backup jobs"
1897,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," ""You guys realize, the entire company is a website That's literally all it is"" So I obviously declined to invest And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker (Laughter) They sell glasses online They were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars And now? My wife handles our investments Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people that I come to call ""originals"
1898,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']", They are people who stand out and speak up Originals drive creativity and change in the world They're the people you want to bet on And they look nothing like I expected I want to show you today three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow getting off the ground
1899,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," Well, I have a confession for you I'm the opposite I'm a precrastinator Yes, that's an actual term You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet I just feel that a few months ahead of time (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop until I had mastered them"
1900,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline And I was proud of that, until a few years ago I had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said, ""I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating"
1901,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," So I challenged her to get some data She goes into a bunch of companies She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are And sure enough, the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators"
1902,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," They didn't fill out my survey"" (Laughter) No, here are our results You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas And on the flip side, the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either There's a sweet spot where originals seem to live Why is this? Maybe original people just have bad work habits"
1903,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," To find out, we designed some experiments We asked people to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are And some of them are asked to do the task right away Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups"
1904,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," It's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps"
1905,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']",""" So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal I started writing the procrastination chapter, and one day — I was halfway through — I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months It was agony"
1906,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," As Aaron Sorkin put it, ""You call it procrastinating I call it thinking"" And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators Take Leonardo da Vinci He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa He felt like a failure He wrote as much in his journal But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter"
1907,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']","? The night before the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history: ""I have a dream"" That was not in the script"
1908,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish And this is what I missed with Warby Parker"
1909,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']",""" They missed the first-mover advantage But what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online And it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better"
1910,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," Look at Facebook, waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster Look at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea than it is to create something new from scratch So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first You just have to be different and better But that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker They were also full of doubts"
1911,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do They just manage it differently Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt There's self-doubt and idea doubt Self-doubt is paralyzing It leads you to freeze"
1912,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four Instead of saying, ""I'm crap,"" you say, ""The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet"" So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use"
1913,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," Now, some of you are not going to like the results of this study — (Laughter) But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users Yes (Applause) They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way Why? It's not a technical advantage The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge"
1914,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option that was handed to you If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default and ask, is there a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser"
1915,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," And if you do that well, you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu There's a name for it It's called vuja de (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes It's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light for more than half a century In every past version, the main character has been an evil queen"
1916,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever So there's a simple message from this story When you feel doubt, don't let it go (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they're even more afraid of failing to try"
1917,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science, are the chances not taken Elon Musk told me recently, he didn't expect Tesla to succeed He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back, but it was too important not to try And for so many of us, when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try"
1918,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas A lot of people think they will If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid But guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact Take the guy who invented this"
1919,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most Take classical composers, the best of the best Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate"
1920,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," Even the three icons of classical music — Bach, Beethoven, Mozart — had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off But for most of us, if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas"
1921,The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,"['business', 'innovation']"," So if you put all this together, what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us They feel fear and doubt They procrastinate They have bad ideas And sometimes, it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed So when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did Don't write them off And when that's you, don't count yourself out either"
1922,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication'],"Hi Let me ask the audience a question: Did you ever lie as a child? If you did, could you please raise your hand? Wow! This is the most honest group of people I've ever met (Laughter) So for the last 20 years, I've been studying how children learn to tell lies And today, I'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made But to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr"
1923,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," He got a phone call one day The caller says, ""Mr Messina, my son Johnny will not come to school today because he's sick"" Mr Messina asks, ""Who am I speaking to, please?"" And the caller says, ""I am my father"" (Laughter) So this story — (Laughter) sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying One, children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school Two, children are poor liars"
1924,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," And three, if children lie at a very young age, there must be some character flaws with them, and they are going to become pathological liars for life Well, it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong We have been playing guessing games with children all over the world Here is an example So in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards And we tell them if they win the game, they are going to get a big prize"
1925,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," And before we leave the room, we tell them not to peek at the cards Of course, we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move Because the desire to win the game is so strong, more than 90 percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room"
1926,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," At three years of age, 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth At four years of age, more than 80 percent lie And after four years of age, most children lie So as you can see, lying is really a typical part of development And some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age So now, let's take a closer look at the younger children"
1927,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," And good lying requires two key ingredients The first key ingredient is theory of mind, or the mind-reading ability Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what I know and what you know Mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that I know you don't know what I know Therefore, I can lie to you"
1928,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," It is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression and your body language, so that you can tell a convincing lie And we found that those young children who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars As it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society"
1929,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," So if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie, instead of being alarmed, you should celebrate — (Laughter) because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone of typical development Now, are children poor liars? Do you think you can easily detect their lies? Would you like to give it a try? Yes? OK So I'm going to show you two videos"
1930,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," Here's child number one Are you ready? (Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No Kang Lee: And this is child number two (Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No KL: OK, if you think child number one is lying, please raise your hand And if you think child number two is lying, please raise your hand OK, so as a matter of fact, child number one is telling the truth, child number two is lying"
1931,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," (Laughter) Now, we have played similar kinds of games with many, many adults from all walks of life And we show them many videos In half of the videos, the children lied In the other half of the videos, the children told the truth And let's find out how these adults performed Because there are as many liars as truth tellers, if you guess randomly, there's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right"
1932,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," So let's start with undergrads and law school students, who typically have limited experience with children No, they cannot detect children's lies Their performance is around chance Now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers, who work with children on a daily basis? Can they detect children's lies? No, they cannot"
1933,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," What about parents? Can parents detect other children's lies? No, they cannot What about, can parents detect their own children's lies? No, they cannot (Laughter) (Applause) So now you may ask why children's lies are so difficult to detect Let me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan This is his facial expression when he lies (Laughter) So when children lie, their facial expression is typically neutral"
1934,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," (Laughter) Unfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us So in the last five years, we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions Then we made a discovery We know that underneath our facial skin, there's a rich network of blood vessels When we experience different emotions, our facial blood flow changes subtly"
1935,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," By looking at facial blood flow changes, we can reveal people's hidden emotions Unfortunately, such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye So to help us reveal people's facial emotions, we have developed a new imaging technology we call ""transdermal optical imaging"" To do so, we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions"
1936,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," By looking at transdermal video images, now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions And using this technology, we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying, and therefore detect people's lies We can do so noninvasively, remotely, inexpensively, with an accuracy at about 85 percent, which is far better than chance level And in addition, we discovered a Pinocchio effect"
1937,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," (Laughter) This is the real Pinocchio effect When people lie, the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases, and the facial blood flow on the nose increases Of course, lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions So then we asked ourselves, in addition to detecting lies, how can our technology be used? One application is in education"
1938,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," And also we can use this in health care For example, every day I Skype my parents, who live thousands of miles away And using this technology, I can not only find out what's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate, their stress level, their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain And perhaps in the future, their risks for heart attack or hypertension"
1939,Can you really tell if a kid is lying?,Kang Lee,['communication']," Well, the answer is yes Using TV footage, we could detect the politicians' heart rate, mood and stress, and perhaps in the future, whether or not they are lying to us We can also use this in marketing research, for example, to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products We can even use it in dating"
1940,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']","I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company, 81's platoon, out in Camp Pendleton, California Oorah! Audience: Oorah! (Laughter) I joined a few months after September 11, feeling like I think most people in the country did at the time, filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution and the desire to do something — that, coupled with that fact that I wasn't doing anything"
1941,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," I can spell that later for people who are interested — (Laughter) Mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not, so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays I did in high school and Blockbuster Video, may she rest in peace"
1942,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," I also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey that I always heard stories about, of actors moving to LA with, like, seven dollars and finding work and successful careers I got as far as Amarillo, Texas, before my car broke down"
1943,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," parents' house, paying rent, selling vacuums  telemarketing, cutting grass at the local 4-H fairgrounds This was my world going into September, 2001 So after the 11th, and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty, and just being pissed off in general — at myself, my parents, the government; not having confidence, not having a respectable job, my shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back — I joined the Marine Corps and loved it"
1944,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," It's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life Firing weapons was cool, driving and detonating expensive things was great But I found I loved the Marine Corps the most for the thing I was looking for the least when I joined, which was the people: these weird dudes — a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the United States — that on the surface I had nothing in common with"
1945,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," And then, a few years into my service and months away from deploying to Iraq, I dislocated my sternum in a mountain-biking accident, and had to be medically separated Those never in the military may find this hard to understand, but being told I wasn't getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan was very devastating for me"
1946,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," And then, suddenly, I was a civilian again I knew I wanted to give acting another shot, because — again, this is me — I thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military I mean, what can you really bitch about now, you know? ""It's hot Someone should turn on the air conditioner"" ""This coffee line is too long"" I was a Marine, I knew how to survive I'd go to New York and become an actor"
1947,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," (Laughter) I re-auditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky, I got in But I was surprised by how complex the transition was from military to civilian And I was relatively healthy; I can't imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injury But regardless, it was difficult"
1948,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," But also, because I didn't know how to apply the things I learned in the military to a civilian context I mean that both practically and emotionally Practically, I had to get a job And I was an Infantry Marine, where you're shooting machine guns and firing mortars There's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world (Laughter) Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning In the military, everything has meaning"
1949,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," You can't smoke in the field because you don't want to give away your position You don't touch your face — you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene You face this way when ""Colors"" plays, out of respect for people who went before you Walk this way, talk this way because of this Your uniform is maintained to the inch How diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes about the kind of Marine you were"
1950,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," In the civilian world there's no rank Here you're just another body, and I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again And the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform didn't exist when I was out of it There didn't seem to be a  a sense of community, whereas in the military, I felt this sense of community"
1951,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," (Laughter) I was really, for the first time, discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military, but were somehow describing my military experience in a way that before to me was indescribable And I felt myself becoming less aggressive as I was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was"
1952,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," I saw my friends battling these circumstances, and I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me, not being able to express our feelings about it The military and theater communities are actually very similar You have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves; it's not about you You have a role, you have to know your role within that team"
1953,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," You're forced to be intimate with complete strangers in a short amount of time; the self-discipline, the self-maintenance"
1954,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," The point is more, how great would it be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible without being condescending So we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces, where we tried to do that, tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities"
1955,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," It's a powerful thing, getting in a room with complete strangers and reminding ourselves of our humanity, and that self-expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder And for an organization like the military, that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms, you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience"
1956,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," We've gone all over the United States and the world, from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland, to Camp Pendleton, to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, to USAG Bavaria, on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York And for the performing artists we bring, it's a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to And for the military, it's the exact same And in doing this for the past six years, I'm always reminded that acting is many things"
1957,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," But it's also a service I didn't get to finish mine, so whenever I get to be of service to this ultimate service industry, the military, for me, again — there's not many things better than that Thank you (Applause) We're going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez, called ""I am not Batman"" An incredible actor and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez, is going to be reading, and Matt Johnson, who I just met a couple hours ago"
1958,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson (Applause) Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like mad, radioactive red And if you squint, you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city, like a mosquito net that won't let the angels in (Drum beat) And if you look up high enough, you can see me standing on the edge of an 87-story building"

1963,My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,"['communication', 'entertainment']"," And somewhere there's a man, a man in a janitor's uniform, stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer, and the other half on a four-hour visit to some lady's house on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people who'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark"

1974,"Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,"['communication', 'humanity']"," I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us — each of you — is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing"

The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,"['communication', 'humanity']",""" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit"" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you So let me explain why this is so"
1976,"Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,"['communication', 'humanity']"," They spell out the acronym OCEAN So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life ""E"" — ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people ""A"" — ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable And ""N"" — ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable"
1977,"Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,"['communication', 'humanity']"," And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing"

The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,"['communication', 'humanity']"," But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own"
1993,"Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,"['communication', 'humanity']"," (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation And a real extrovert came in beside me — not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over — and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate — even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr"

1995,The agony of trying to unsubscribe,James Veitch,"['communication', 'technology', 'business']"," (Laughter) Settle down (Laughter) People say we live in an age of information overload Right? I don't know about that, but I just know that I get too many marketing emails I got a marketing email from a supermarket firm, which will remain nameless for predominantly legal reasons, but which I'm going to call ""SafeMart"
1996,The agony of trying to unsubscribe,James Veitch,"['communication', 'technology', 'business']"," So what I did was I scrolled down to the bottom of the email, and I pressed, ""Unsubscribe"" And I thought that'd be the end of it But a week later, I got another one that said, ""Just two weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"" And I thought, obviously, I haven't clicked hard enough So I tried it again"
1997,The agony of trying to unsubscribe,James Veitch,"['communication', 'technology', 'business']"," It's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinely matter in this world and the minutiae of life, without having emails about supermarket chains and Candy Crush Saga And I was really annoyed with them, and I thought, OK, I was about to write a strongly worded email, which I can do quite well (Laughter) And I thought, no — I'm going to find the game"

2003,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']","The last time I heard my son's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school He called out one word in the darkness: ""Bye"" It was April 20, 1999 Later that morning, at Columbine High School, my son Dylan and his friend Eric killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives Thirteen innocent people were killed, leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma"
2004,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," But the enormity of the tragedy can't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place There's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school, or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts There's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine, especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own"
2005,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," It has taken me years to try to accept my son's legacy The cruel behavior that defined the end of his life showed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew Afterwards people asked, ""How could you not know? What kind of a mother were you?"" I still ask myself those same questions Before the shootings, I thought of myself as a good mom"
2006,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," But the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent, and it's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today Aside from his father, I was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most If anyone could have known what was happening, it should have been me, right? But I didn't know Today, I'm here to share the experience of what it's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts"
2007,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," But there are no simple answers I can't give you any solutions All I can do is share what I have learned When I talk to people who didn't know me before the shootings, I have three challenges to meet First, when I walk into a room like this, I never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn't here to do it for himself"
2008,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," The second challenge I have is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion when I talk about my son's death as a suicide Two years before he died, he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself He said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life I didn't know about any of this until months after his death"
2009,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," I'm trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder After a lot of reading and talking with experts, I have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill but in his desire to die"
2010,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," And in the same breath, I'm talking about violence The last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness Only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people, but of those who die by suicide, it's estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind"
2011,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," Many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated Too often, they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis If estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person, when suicide rates rise, as they are rising for some populations, the murder-suicide rates will rise as well"
2012,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," I did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events, and whenever I could, I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt One of the most helpful conversations I had was with a coworker who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle She heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did"
2013,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," She said that when she was a young, single mother with three small children, she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe At the time, she was certain that her children would be better off if she died, so she had made a plan to end her life"
2014,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," What she said and what I've learned from others is that we do not make the so-called decision or choice to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to drive or where to go on a Saturday night When someone is in an extremely suicidal state, they are in a stage four medical health emergency Their thinking is impaired and they've lost access to tools of self-governance"
2015,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," Some people can be very good at hiding this state, and they often have good reasons for doing that Many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point, but persistent, ongoing thoughts of suicide and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology, and like many illnesses, the condition has to be recognized and treated before a life is lost But my son's death was not purely a suicide It involved mass murder"
2016,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," But research is sparse and there are no simple answers Yes, he probably had ongoing depression He had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant, and that made him less likely to seek help from others He had experienced triggering events at the school that left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad"
2017,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," And on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility, Dylan found access to guns even though we'd never owned any in our home It was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns, both legally and illegally, without my permission or knowledge And somehow, 17 years and many school shootings later, it's still appallingly easy"
2018,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," Two years after the shootings, I got breast cancer, and two years after that, I began to have mental health problems On top of the constant, perpetual grief I was terrified that I would run into a family member of someone Dylan had killed, or be accosted by the press or by an angry citizen I was afraid to turn on the news, afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person I started having panic attacks"
2019,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," The second round started six years after the shootings, when I was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide for the first time at a conference Both episodes lasted several weeks The attacks happened everywhere: in the hardware store, in my office, or even while reading a book in bed"
2020,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," It felt as if my brain was trying to kill me, and then, being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts That's when I learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind, and that's when I truly became a brain health advocate With therapy and medication and self-care, life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances"
2021,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," Every time someone asks me, ""How could you not have known?"", it feels like a punch in the gut It carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy I've had I will never fully eradicate But here's something I've learned: if love were enough to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves, suicides would hardly ever happen But love is not enough, and suicide is prevalent"
2022,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can, we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel, and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different, that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else, can cause us to miss what's hidden in plain sight"
2023,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Sue Klebold,"['humanity', 'society', 'social change']"," We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering, regardless of what they say or how they act We should listen with our whole being, without judgments, and without offering solutions I know that I will live with this tragedy, with these multiple tragedies, for the rest of my life I know that in the minds of many, what I lost can't compare to what the other families lost I know my struggle doesn't make theirs any easier"

2025,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," The end of my antigay picketing career and life as I knew it, came 20 years later, triggered in part by strangers on Twitter who showed me the power of engaging the other In my home, life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil The good was my church and its members, and the evil was everyone else My church's antics were such that we were constantly at odds with the world, and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis"

2027,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter Initially, the people I encountered on the platform were just as hostile as I expected They were the digital version of the screaming hordes I'd been seeing at protests since I was a kid But in the midst of that digital brawl, a strange pattern developed"
2028,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," They would be understandably confused and caught off guard, but then a conversation would ensue And it was civil — full of genuine curiosity on both sides How had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world?

2030,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," Why did we advocate the death penalty for gays when Jesus said, ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"" How could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for God to destroy them? The truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction It was growing evidence that people on the other side were not the demons I'd been led to believe These realizations were life-altering"
2031,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," I couldn't justify our actions — especially our cruel practice of protesting funerals and celebrating human tragedy These shifts in my perspective contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church, and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay In spite of overwhelming grief and terror, I left Westboro in 2012 In those days just after I left, the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing"
2032,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," And I wanted to hide from the world I'd rejected for so long — people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance after a lifetime of antagonism And yet, unbelievably, they did The world had access to my past because it was all over the internet — thousands of tweets and hundreds of interviews, everything from local TV news to ""The Howard Stern Show"" — but so many embraced me with open arms anyway"

2040,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," These four steps were small but powerful, and I do everything I can to employ them in difficult conversations today The first is don't assume bad intent My friends on Twitter realized that even when my words were aggressive and offensive, I sincerely believed I was doing the right thing Assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do"
2041,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," But when we assume good or neutral intent, we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue The second is ask questions When we engage people across ideological divides, asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view"
2042,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church. Here's why I left,Megan Phelps-Roper,"['communication', 'humanity', 'social change', 'society']"," But asking questions serves another purpose; it signals to someone that they're being heard When my friends on Twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions, I almost automatically mirrored them Their questions gave me room to speak, but they also gave me permission to ask them questions and to truly hear their responses It fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation The third is stay calm"

2139,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']","Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart and a coldness And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there"
2140,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Coming round from anesthesia is very different I could have been under for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years I simply wasn't there It was total oblivion Anesthesia — it's a modern kind of magic It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people And in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy"
2141,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," And not just any conscious experience — your conscious experience right here and right now How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or pain"
2142,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote And I think this because my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms Consciousness and intelligence are very different things You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive"
2143,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Now, you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers"
2144,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," And the strategy is very simple I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've come to think about life At one time, people thought the property of being alive could not be explained by physics and chemistry — that life had to be more than just mechanism But people no longer think that"
2145,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," So as with life, so with consciousness Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is should start to fade away At least that's the plan So let's get started What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways"
2146,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," And then there's conscious self The specific experience of being you or being me The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly Let's start with experiences of the world around us, and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine Imagine being a brain You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure what's out there in the world There's no lights inside the skull"
2147,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related to things in the world, whatever they may be So perception — figuring out what's there — has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is to form its best guess of what caused those signals The brain doesn't hear sound or see light"
2148,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Let me give you a couple of examples of all this You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think about it in a new way If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact exactly the same shade And I can illustrate this"
2149,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," It's exactly the same shade of gray And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across and join them up It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all This isn't any kind of magic trick It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again, and it looks different"
2150,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience Have a listen to this (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again and see if you can get anything (Distorted voice) Still strange Now listen to this (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea (Laughter) Which I do"
2151,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," I'm just going to replay it (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there Once more for luck (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all All that's changed is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information And that changes what you consciously hear All this puts the brain basis of perception in a bit of a different light"
2152,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," We don't just passively perceive the world, we actively generate it The world we experience comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in Let me give you one more example of perception as this active, constructive process Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience"
2153,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions In this case, to see dogs And you can see this is a very strange thing When perceptual predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis Now, think about this for a minute"
2154,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time, including right now It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations, we call that reality (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain"
2155,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']", But we shouldn't take it for granted There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self There's the experience of having a body and of being a body There are experiences of perceiving the world from a first person point of view There are experiences of intending to do things and of being the cause of things that happen in the world
2156,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Many experiments show, and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well, that these different ways in which we experience being a self can all come apart What this means is the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain Another experience, which just like all others, requires explanation So let's return to the bodily self"
2157,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not part of its body And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home All you need is one of these (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them"
2158,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand is in fact part of their body And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body (Laughter) So you can measure all kinds of clever things"
2159,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand This means that even experiences of what our body is is a kind of best guessing — a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain There's one more thing We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside"
2160,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," This kind of perception, which we call interoception, is rather overlooked But it's critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body — well, that's what keeps us alive Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion This is from our lab at Sussex And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time with their heartbeat"
2161,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us When I look around me, the world seems full of objects — tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot — even my own body in the world, I can perceive it as an object from the outside"
2162,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen  I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere I don't perceive my insides as objects In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong And this is important, I think"
2163,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there, we perceive objects as the causes of sensations When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things, we experience how well or how badly that control is going So our most basic experiences of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive"
2164,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of our living bodies Let me bring things together step-by-step What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess of what's out there Our experienced world comes from the inside out, not just the outside in The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body"
2165,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," And finally, experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it — well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity We predict ourselves into existence Now, I leave you with three implications of all this"
2166,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia Second: what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated"
2167,Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality,Anil Seth,"['humanity', 'science']"," Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible way of being conscious And even human consciousness generally — it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures"
2168,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment'],"Did you know that every time musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off all over their brain? On the outside, they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise and practiced movements required But inside their brains, there's a party going on"
2169,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," When people are hooked up to these machines, tasks, such as reading or doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain where activity can be observed But when researchers got the participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks"
2170,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," And our brains do all this work in the split second between when we first hear the music and when our foot starts to tap along But when scientists turned from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks became a jubilee It turns out that while listening to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent of a full-body workout"
2171,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," But what is it about making music that sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists have a pretty good idea Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area of the brain at once, especially the visual, auditory, and motor cortices As with any other workout, disciplined, structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions, allowing us to apply that strength to other activities"
2172,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," It also combines the linguistic and mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere is more involved, with the novel and creative content that the right excels in For these reasons, playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity in the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain faster and through more diverse routes"
2173,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," Because making music also involves crafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels of executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing, and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis of both cognitive and emotional aspects This ability also has an impact on how our memory systems work"
2174,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," Studies have found that musicians appear to use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag, an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine"
2175,How playing an instrument benefits your brain,Anita Collins,['entertainment']," And several randomized studies of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function and neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed to a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple brain areas, compared to the others"
2176,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity'],"I used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness Everyone said the path to happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend, that beautiful apartment But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift And I wasn't alone; my friends — they struggled with this, too Eventually, I decided to go to graduate school for positive psychology to learn what truly makes people happy"
2177,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising around the world, and it recently reached a 30-year high in America Even though life is getting objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone There's an emptiness gnawing away at people, and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it"
2178,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life But that raised some questions for me Is there more to life than being happy? And what's the difference between being happy and having meaning in life? Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment Meaning, though, is deeper"
2179,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path And the studies show that people who have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live longer"
2180,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all of these pillars in our lives The first pillar is belonging Belonging comes from being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well"
2181,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," True belonging springs from love It lives in moments among individuals, and it's a choice — you can choose to cultivate belonging with others Here's an example Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York They don't just conduct a transaction, though They take a moment to slow down, talk, and treat each other like humans"
2182,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity'],""" But Jonathan insisted on paying, so he went to the store and bought something he didn't need to make change But when he gave the money to the vendor, the vendor drew back He was hurt He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it I do I'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me"
2183,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," They make them feel invisible and unworthy But when you lead with love, you create a bond that lifts each of you up For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose Now, finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give"
2184,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," Many parents tell me, ""My purpose is raising my children"" The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others Of course, for many of us, that happens through work That's how we contribute and feel needed But that also means that issues like disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation — these aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder"
2185,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way: transcendence Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected to a higher reality For one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art For another person, it was at church For me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing"
2186,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," These transcendent experiences can change you One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute But afterwards they felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone Belonging, purpose, transcendence Now, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found, tends to surprise people The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself about yourself"
2187,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," It helps you understand how you became you But we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them Your life isn't just a list of events You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts I met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football After his injury, Emeka told himself, ""My life was great playing football, but now look at me"
2188,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," Now it's bad"" — tend to be more anxious and depressed And that was Emeka for a while But with time, he started to weave a different story His new story was, ""Before my injury, my life was purposeless I partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy But my injury made me realize I could be a better man"" That edit to his story changed Emeka's life"
2189,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a ""redemptive story,"" where the bad is redeemed by the good People leading meaningful lives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love"
2190,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," That's what Emeka did You won't change your story overnight; it could take years and be painful After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars"
2191,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," Sufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home to meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories Their practice also involved serving all of creation through small acts of love, which meant being kind even when people wronged you But it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego"
2192,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," And I started searching for those things that make life worth living That's what set me on this journey Looking back, I now realize that the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply Of course, the same principle applies in other strong communities as well — good ones and bad ones"
2193,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," But that's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives We need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves But living a meaningful life takes work It's an ongoing process As each day goes by, we're constantly creating our lives, adding to our story And sometimes we can get off track Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience I had with my father"
2194,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," He survived, and when I asked him what was going through his mind as he faced death, he said all he could think about was needing to live so he could be there for my brother and me, and this gave him the will to fight for life When he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery, instead of counting backwards from 10, he repeated our names like a mantra He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth if he died"
2195,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,['humanity']," It's a humble life, but a good life Lying there facing death, he had a reason to live: love His sense of belonging within his family, his purpose as a dad, his transcendent meditation, repeating our names — these, he says, are the reasons why he survived That's the story he tells himself That's the power of meaning Happiness comes and goes"
2196,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']","At some point in our lives, almost every one of us will have our heart broken My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school She would meet her future husband by age 27, get engaged a year later and get married a year after that But when Kathy turned 27, she didn't find a husband She found a lump in her breast"
2197,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Kathy recovered, though, and she was eager to resume her search for a husband as soon as her eyebrows grew back in When you're going on first dates in New York City, you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions (Laughter) Soon afterwards, she met Rich and fell in love The relationship was everything she hoped it would be"
2198,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Kathy knew he was going to propose, and she could barely contain her excitement But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night He broke up with her As deeply as he cared for Kathy — and he did — he simply wasn't in love Kathy was shattered Her heart was truly broken, and she now faced yet another recovery But five months after the breakup, Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Rich Her heart was still very much broken"
2199,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you For example, we know from studies of heartbroken people that having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended is really important for our ability to move on Yet time and again, when we are offered a simple and honest explanation like the one Rich offered Kathy, we reject it Heartbreak creates such dramatic emotional pain, our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic"
2200,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Kathy became convinced something must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship, and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was And so she spent countless hours going through every minute of that weekend in her mind, searching her memory for clues that were not there Kathy's mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase"
2201,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," There is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another, even when we know it's going to make us feel worse Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids Kathy was going through withdrawal"
2202,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Her instincts told her she was trying to solve a mystery, but what she was actually doing was getting her fix This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal Addicts know they're addicted They know when they're shooting up But heartbroken people do not But you do now And if your heart is broken, you cannot ignore that"
2203,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Getting over heartbreak is not a journey It's a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon There is no breakup explanation that's going to feel satisfying No rationale can take away the pain you feel So don't search for one, don't wait for one, just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself and then put the question to rest, because you need that closure to resist the addiction"
2204,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Otherwise, your mind will feed on your hope and set you back Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken Heartbreak is a master manipulator The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it"
2205,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," All that does is make our loss feel more painful We know that Yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another, like we were being held hostage by our own passive-aggressive Spotify playlist (Laughter) Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind"
2206,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," What I tell my patients is to compile an exhaustive list of all the ways the person was wrong for you, all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves, and then keep it on your phone (Laughter) And once you have your list, you have to use it When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff of nostalgia in a session, I go, ""Phone, please"" (Laughter) Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect"
2207,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," And if you want to get over them, you have to remind yourself of that, frequently None of us is immune to heartbreak My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old senior executive in a software company Five years after his wife died, he finally felt ready to start dating again He soon met Sharon, and a whirlwind romance ensued They introduced each other to their adult children after one month, and they moved in together after two"
2208,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," It's like ""Love, Actually"" meets ""The Fast and the Furious"" (Laughter) Miguel was happier than he had been in years But the night before their first anniversary, Sharon left him She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children, and she didn't want a long-distance relationship Miguel was totally blindsided and utterly devastated He barely functioned at work for many, many months, and he almost lost his job as a result"
2209,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," It temporarily lowers our IQ But it wasn't just the intensity of Miguel's grief that confused his employers; it was the duration Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it ""What's wrong with me?"" he asked me in our session ""What adult spends almost a year getting over a one-year relationship?"" Actually, many do"
2210,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury It impacts us in a multitude of ways For example, Sharon was both very social and very active She had dinners at the house every week She and Miguel went on camping trips with other couples Although Miguel was not religious, he accompanied Sharon to church every Sunday, where he was welcomed into the congregation"
2211,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," He lost his identity as a couple Now, Miguel recognized the breakup had left this huge void in his life, but what he failed to recognize is that it left far more than just one And that is crucial, not just because it explains why heartbreak could be so devastating, but because it tells us how to heal To fix your broken heart, you have to identify these voids in your life and fill them, and I mean all of them"
2212,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," The voids in your social life, the missing activities, even the empty spaces on the wall where pictures used to hang"
2213,How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,"['humanity', 'social change']"," Getting over heartbreak is hard, but if you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take steps to heal, you can significantly minimize your suffering And it won't just be you who benefit from that You'll be more present with your friends, more engaged with your family, not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided"
2214,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']","What if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity"
2215,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," And that can last for the rest of your life So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today"
2216,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it So here is a real preserved human brain And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here"
2217,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," And that structure is called the hippocampus So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand"
2218,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program"
2219,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise And I did it in a completely inadvertent way I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing — data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work And it should have been going great It was, scientifically But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something I had no social life"
2220,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all I had gained 25 pounds And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable And I shouldn't be miserable And I went on a river-rafting trip — by myself, because I had no social life And I came back — (Laughter) thinking, ""Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip"" And I came back with a mission"
2221,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']",""" And that's what made me go to the gym And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym I tried everything I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost And that's what kept me going back to the gym Well, I started feeling stronger"
2222,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before And that thought was, ""Gee, grant-writing is going well today"
2223,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before And my long-term memory — what I was studying in my own lab — seemed to be better in me And that's when I put it together"
2224,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention"
2225,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain"
2226,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours"
2227,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus"
2228,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters"
2229,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," Here you can think about the brain like a muscle The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging"
2230,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, ""That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes"" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question"
2231,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in That is, get your heart rate up And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk You see stairs — take stairs"
2232,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you — three to four times a week, 30 minutes"
2233,The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,"['health', 'science']"," But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up (Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left And I say, I am strong now Let's hear you"

2236,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," I hope (Laughter) I hope that's happening So because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time We're able to transmit knowledge across minds I can put a bizarre new idea in your mind right now I could say, ""Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library while thinking about quantum mechanics"
2237,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," (Laughter) But now I've just made you think it, through language Now of course, there isn't just one language in the world, there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world And all the languages differ from one another in all kinds of ways Some languages have different sounds, they have different vocabularies, and they also have different structures — very importantly, different structures"
2238,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," People have been speculating about this question forever Charlemagne, Holy Roman emperor, said, ""To have a second language is to have a second soul"" — strong statement that language crafts reality But on the other hand, Shakespeare has Juliet say, ""What's in a name?

2239,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Recently, in my lab and other labs around the world, we've started doing research, and now we have actual scientific data to weigh in on this question So let me tell you about some of my favorite examples I'll start with an example from an Aboriginal community in Australia that I had the chance to work with These are the Kuuk Thaayorre people They live in Pormpuraaw at the very west edge of Cape York"
2240,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," And when I say everything, I really mean everything You would say something like, ""Oh, there's an ant on your southwest leg"" Or, ""Move your cup to the north-northeast a little bit"" In fact, the way that you say ""hello"" in Kuuk Thaayorre is you say, ""Which way are you going?"" And the answer should be, ""North-northeast in the far distance"
2241,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," (Laughter) But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast, right? Because you literally couldn't get past ""hello,"" if you didn't know which way you were going In fact, people who speak languages like this stay oriented really well They stay oriented better than we used to think humans could"
2242,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']",""" No; if your language and your culture trains you to do it, actually, you can do it There are humans around the world who stay oriented really well And just to get us in agreement about how different this is from the way we do it, I want you all to close your eyes for a second and point southeast (Laughter) Keep your eyes closed Point OK, so you can open your eyes I see you guys pointing there, there, there, there, there "
2243,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," (Laughter) So let's just say the accuracy in this room was not very high This is a big difference in cognitive ability across languages, right? Where one group — very distinguished group like you guys — doesn't know which way is which, but in another group, I could ask a five-year-old and they would know (Laughter) There are also really big differences in how people think about time So here I have pictures of my grandfather at different ages"
2244,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," This has to do with writing direction If you were a speaker of Hebrew or Arabic, you might do it going in the opposite direction, from right to left But how would the Kuuk Thaayorre, this Aboriginal group I just told you about, do it? They don't use words like ""left"" and ""right"" Let me give you hint When we sat people facing south, they organized time from left to right When we sat them facing north, they organized time from right to left"
2245,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," What's the pattern? East to west, right? So for them, time doesn't actually get locked on the body at all, it gets locked on the landscape So for me, if I'm facing this way, then time goes this way, and if I'm facing this way, then time goes this way I'm facing this way, time goes this way — very egocentric of me to have the direction of time chase me around every time I turn my body For the Kuuk Thaayorre, time is locked on the landscape"
2246,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Here's another really smart human trick Suppose I ask you how many penguins are there Well, I bet I know how you'd solve that problem if you solved it You went, ""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight"" You counted them You named each one with a number, and the last number you said was the number of penguins This is a little trick that you're taught to use as kids You learn the number list and you learn how to apply it"
2247,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Well, some languages don't do this, because some languages don't have exact number words They're languages that don't have a word like ""seven"" or a word like ""eight"" In fact, people who speak these languages don't count, and they have trouble keeping track of exact quantities So, for example, if I ask you to match this number of penguins to the same number of ducks, you would be able to do that by counting"
2248,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Languages also differ in how they divide up the color spectrum — the visual world Some languages have lots of words for colors, some have only a couple words, ""light"" and ""dark"" And languages differ in where they put boundaries between colors So, for example, in English, there's a word for blue that covers all of the colors that you can see on the screen, but in Russian, there isn't a single word"
2249,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']",""" So Russians have this lifetime of experience of, in language, distinguishing these two colors When we test people's ability to perceptually discriminate these colors, what we find is that Russian speakers are faster across this linguistic boundary They're faster to be able to tell the difference between a light and dark blue"
2250,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Languages have all kinds of structural quirks This is one of my favorites Lots of languages have grammatical gender; every noun gets assigned a gender, often masculine or feminine And these genders differ across languages So, for example, the sun is feminine in German but masculine in Spanish, and the moon, the reverse"
2251,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," So if you ask German and Spanish speakers to, say, describe a bridge, like the one here — ""bridge"" happens to be grammatically feminine in German, grammatically masculine in Spanish — German speakers are more likely to say bridges are ""beautiful,"" ""elegant"" and stereotypically feminine words Whereas Spanish speakers will be more likely to say they're ""strong"" or ""long,"" these masculine words"
2252,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," In English, it's fine to say, ""He broke the vase"" In a language like Spanish, you might be more likely to say, ""The vase broke,"" or, ""The vase broke itself"" If it's an accident, you wouldn't say that someone did it In English, quite weirdly, we can even say things like, ""I broke my arm"" Now, in lots of languages, you couldn't use that construction unless you are a lunatic and you went out looking to break your arm — (Laughter) and you succeeded"
2253,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Now, this has consequences So, people who speak different languages will pay attention to different things, depending on what their language usually requires them to do So we show the same accident to English speakers and Spanish speakers, English speakers will remember who did it, because English requires you to say, ""He did it; he broke the vase"
2254,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," They're more likely to remember the intention So, two people watch the same event, witness the same crime, but end up remembering different things about that event This has implications, of course, for eyewitness testimony It also has implications for blame and punishment"
2255,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']",""" The language guides our reasoning about events Now, I've given you a few examples of how language can profoundly shape the way we think, and it does so in a variety of ways So language can have big effects, like we saw with space and time, where people can lay out space and time in completely different coordinate frames from each other Language can also have really deep effects — that's what we saw with the case of number"
2256,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Of course, if you don't count, you can't do algebra, you can't do any of the things that would be required to build a room like this or make this broadcast, right? This little trick of number words gives you a stepping stone into a whole cognitive realm Language can also have really early effects, what we saw in the case of color These are really simple, basic, perceptual decisions"
2257,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Language can have really broad effects So the case of grammatical gender may be a little silly, but at the same time, grammatical gender applies to all nouns That means language can shape how you're thinking about anything that can be named by a noun That's a lot of stuff And finally, I gave you an example of how language can shape things that have personal weight to us — ideas like blame and punishment or eyewitness memory"
2258,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," Now, the beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000 — there are 7,000 languages spoken around the world And we can create many more — languages, of course, are living things, things that we can hone and change to suit our needs The tragic thing is that we're losing so much of this linguistic diversity all the time"
2259,How language shapes the way we think,Lera Boroditsky,"['science', 'humanity', 'communication']"," And the even worse news is that right now, almost everything we know about the human mind and human brain is based on studies of usually American English-speaking undergraduates at universities That excludes almost all humans Right? So what we know about the human mind is actually incredibly narrow and biased, and our science has to do better I want to leave you with this final thought"
2260,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']","Thank you very much Well, I would like to start with testicles (Laughter) Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more (Laughter) In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness"
2261,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," This is the best news that I have for you today (Laughter) From this point, it may only get worse Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough, both for your brain and for your body"
2262,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new information And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain essentially become waterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories So let me show you the data Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea"
2263,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved"
2264,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," And then we're going to test them to see how effective that learning has been And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis And when you put those two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep I think this should be concerning, considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now"
2265,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of learning disabilities And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain It's very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them"
2266,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files — they were just being bounced You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back to that control group for a second"
2267,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them, making them safe And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits, because there are real medical and societal implications"
2268,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing And only last year, we finally published evidence that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated"
2269,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news It's in the mail It's coming at you But there's a potential silver lining here Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging, for example changes in the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able to do something about it"
2270,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this It's called direct current brain stimulation You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact"
2271,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," The question now is whether we can translate this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function? That is my real hope now That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were So that's an example of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just as essential for your body"
2272,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour Because there is a global experiment performed on 16 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day"
2273,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," Isn't that incredible? And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system"
2274,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough"
2275,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," And it's not small — it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity That's a concerning state of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast"
2276,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead Well, I'm being quite serious now — it is mortally unwise advice We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality"
2277,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night And there were two critical findings First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep"
2278,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," The other half were decreased Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system, so once again, you can see that immune deficiency"
2279,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative"
2280,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," The first is regularity Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep The second is keep it cool"
2281,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people And then finally, in taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical statement here? Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity"
2282,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education of our children It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges that we face in the 21st century"
2283,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all  I do hope you sleep well Thank you very much indeed (Applause) Thank you (Applause) Thank you so much David Biello: No, no, no Stay there for a second Good job not running away, though I appreciate that So that was terrifying"
2284,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," DB: Yes, thank you, thank you Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do? What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else? MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep Sleep is not like the bank You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time"
2285,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," DB: Because we're smart MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body So you just have to prioritize"
2286,Sleep is your superpower,Matt Walker,"['health', 'science']"," The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn the association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep"
2287,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication'],"""Sorry, my phone died"" ""It's nothing I'm fine"" ""These allegations are completely unfounded"" ""The company was not aware of any wrongdoing"" ""I love you"
2288,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," But although such tools have worked under certain circumstances, most can be fooled with enough preparation, and none are considered reliable enough to even be admissible in court"
2289,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," But while our brain is busy dreaming, it's letting plenty of signals slip by Our conscious mind only controls about 5% of our cognitive function, including communication, while the other 95% occurs beyond our awareness, and according to the literature on reality monitoring, stories based on imagined experiences are qualitatively different from those based on real experiences"
2290,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the subconscious language of deception First, liars reference themselves less, when making deceptive statements They write or talk more about others, often using the third person to distance and disassociate themselves from their lie, which sounds more false: ""Absolutely no party took place at this house,"" or ""I didn't host a party here"
2291,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," For example, a liar might say something like, ""Sorry, my stupid phone battery died I hate that thing"" Third, liars typically explain events in simple terms since our brains struggle to build a complex lie Judgment and evaluation are complex things for our brains to compute As a US President once famously insisted: ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman"
2292,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," Another President confronted with a scandal proclaimed: ""I can say, categorically, that this investigation indicates that no one on the White House staff, no one in this administration presently employed was involved in this very bizarre incident"" Let's apply linguistic analysis to some famous examples Take seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong"
2293,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," Note the contrast between the following two quotes First: ""Okay, you know, a guy in a French, in a Parisian laboratory opens up your sample, you know, Jean-Francis so-and-so, and he tests it And then you get a phone call from a newspaper that says: 'We found you to be positive six times for EPO"" Second: ""I lost myself in all of that"
2294,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," I controlled every outcome in my life"" In his denial, Armstrong described a hypothetical situation focused on someone else, removing himself from the situation entirely In his admission, he owns his statements, delving into his personal emotions and motivations But the use of personal pronouns is just one indicator of deception Let's look at another example from former Senator and US"
2295,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," I also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested, agreed to, or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby"" Not only is that a pretty long-winded way to say, ""The baby isn't mine,"" but Edwards never calls the other parties by name, instead saying ""that baby,"" ""the woman,"" and ""the apparent father"
2296,The language of lying,Noah Zandan,['communication']," I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserves"" The statement is short and direct, calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life So how can you apply these lie-spotting techniques to your life? First, remember that many of the lies we encounter on a daily basis are far less serious that these examples, and may even be harmless"
